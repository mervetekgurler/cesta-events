We'll be using Python. If you've got a good Python setup already, great! But make sure that it is at least Python version 3.8. If not, the easiest thing to do is to make sure you have at least 3GB free on your computer and then to head over to (https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and install the Python 3 version of Anaconda. It will work on any operating system.

After you have installed conda, close any open terminals you might have. Then open a new terminal and run the following command:

# 1. Create an environment with dependencies specified in env.yml:
    conda env create -f env.yml

# 2. Activate the new environment:
    conda activate cesta
    
# 3. Inside the new environment, install IPython kernel so we can use this environment in jupyter notebook: 
 
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name cesta
    
# 5. click on Kernel -> Change kernel, you should see and select cesta in the drop-down menu.

# To deactivate an active environment, use
    conda deactivate
