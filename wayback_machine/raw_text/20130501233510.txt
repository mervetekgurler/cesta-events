The Center For Spatial and Textual Analysis and The Department of History presents

Between Two Booms:

The Human and Environmental Consequences of Brazilian Ethanol Production

a talk by

Thomas D. Rogers

Assistant Professor of Modern Latin American History

Emory University

May 9,  2013 at 4:15pm

at the

Center For Spatial And Textual Analysis

4th Floor,  Wallenberg Hall,  450 Serra Mall,  Stanford University

Abstract: Brazil has experienced two booms in sugarcane ethanol production in the past 40 years,  the first taking place under an authoritarian military regime that used the power of the state to foment production and the second taking place under the tutelage of the Workers’ Party’s government in its search for a new developmental model. Inflation-plagued and debt-ridden administrations intervened between the two booms, during which time the framework of the first surge—including several state agencies—was dismantled. This talk will assess the environmental and political consequences of the first ethanol boom and place it in historical context.

Professor Rogers is the author of
 The Deepest Wounds: A Labor and Environmental History of Sugar in Northeast Brazil
 (The University of North Carolina Press, 2010). The book was awarded the Warren Dean Prize from the Conference on Latin American History and the Henry A. Wallace Prize from the Agricultural History Society.

Matthew Booker, a close affiliate and collaborator with CESTA, has a new publication out. It contains materials created at the Spatial History Lab, and Matthew’s work in the lab helped contribute to the final version of the book.

Here is the link:

There will likely be an official book launch at the California Historical Society in July – we’ll post details once we have them.

Congrats, Matthew!

The CESTA community would like to welcome the new Humanities + Design graduate fellows! The new grad fellows are Nicole DeBenedictis, Claude Willan, Maria Teodora Comsa, Marcelo Alejandro Aranda, and Hannah Marcus.

Beyond the exciting work that the fellows will be doing within Humanities + Design, this marks a new effort by CESTA to support graduate professional development as well as our already very strong undergraduate program.

	                	The View and The Value: Historical Geography of Signs in San Francisco	                

Hello All,

Join me next Friday, April 12th, at 10:15 A.M. for a presentation of my senior thesis project. I will be speaking in CESTA’s Gold + Honey room, on the fourth floor of Wallenberg Hall (Bldg 160). See flyer below:

The View and The Value: 

Historical Geography of Signs in San Francisco

A senior thesis in the Department of History

[Photo: A survey from the enforcement of the 1965 Highway Beautification Act (HBA)]

My research examines signs in the public view of San Francisco, from the 1890s to the present. This curious and surprising line of local history indicates how cultural values influence the organization of space, relying upon maps identifying 
where 
and 
when 
signs have existed and textual sources that compare the laws of public versus private signage. With this case study, I hope to demonstrate the points at which property rights intersect and conflict with the freedom of speech.

During the past decade, corporate expenditures for advertising completed the shift away from print media and toward digital formats. Outdoor advertising experienced no such decline. I argue that the outdoor medium will become increasingly relevant, but the industry will become unrecognizable in the digital age. Soon, the development of virtual spaces for public and private speech will raise new questions about the management of real space. Can the ongoing controversy over online privacy inform the future of public control over open spaces? The answer requires proof that billboards create value for cities–or proof of the opposite.

Curating the Bay: Crowdsourcing a New Environmental History

April 7, 2013 – August 25, 2013

Opening Celebration, Sunday, April 7th, 4:00PM – 6:00PM

Free event, please RSVP at

.

California Historical Society is embracing 21st-century technology to celebrate the Year of the Bay in 2013, by offering its extensive collections to a crowdsourcing experiment in its gallery and at 
yearofthebay.org
.

In a year that is bringing the high-profile America’s Cup yacht races to the Bay, the opening of a new Bay Bridge span, and the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Port of San Francisco, the California Historical Society is staging an experimental exhibition of many items from its collections not publicly exhibited before. Many of these artifacts — photographs, paintings, and documents — present historical mysteries still to be solved. The historical society is welcoming the public into this rich collection of materials to contribute their own stories, knowledge, photographs, and other sources to create a richer, more diverse history of the San Francisco Bay.

The exhibition takes risks by asking visitors to fill in the blanks rather than presenting them with a finished narrative. It opens up the process of curating — usually reserved for trained professionals — to the public both in the exhibition and online as part of 
yearofthebay.org
, a dynamic crowdsourcing experiment with researchers at Stanford University and Historypin, an innovative global social technology partner.

This exhibition has been generously supported by our funding sponsors: S.D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation, Placer Partners, Port of San Francisco, and Wells Fargo. Exhibition partners include: Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis at Stanford University, EcoCenter at Heron’s Head Park, Golden Gate Audubon, Heyday, Historypin, Literacy for Environmental Justice, Port of San Francisco, San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, and San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. In-kind support is being provided by: The CBW Group, Hafner Vineyard, Herglotz Public Affairs, Lagunitas Brewing Company, and Sherwin-Williams. Institutional support to CHS is provided from the Hearst Foundation, Hewlett-Packard, The James Irvine Foundation, and San Francisco Grants for the Arts.

 research team has been hard at work!

Premier of Three New Films to share Struggles for Environment, Justice and Community in East Palo Alto

On Monday, March 18 from 6:30 to 8:30 pm East Palo Alto youth, community organizations, and Stanford University’s Program on Urban Studies will premier 
Homegrown: Cultivating Dreams through Action – 
three unique hip hop documentary films highlighting powerful stories from East Palo Alto. This free, community event will take place in East Palo Alto City Hall, 2145 University Ave.

The films merge hip hop music video and historical documentary approaches and are a product of a unique ten week collaboration between Stanford Urban Studies students and East Palo Alto youth lyricists. Coming together as part of a class about EPA environmental issues, the teams of Stanford students and youth lyricists partnered to edit films and create sound tracks that tell three important stories in a fresh new way:

Youth United for Community Action’s (YUCAs) campaign to close the Romic hazardous wastes recycling in an effort lasting nearly a decade and leading to state action to close the plant forever

Peoples’ irrepressible desire to farm the land in East Palo Alto, and cross race, culture and time in the effort to grow their own local food -  from a time when African American community activists farmed the “Back 40” to today’s efforts by Collective Roots.

The Weeks Neighborhood Plan and East Palo Alto Historical and Agricultural Society’s vision to use the plentiful land to build self-sufficiency and community through a locally-based food system.

Films are a product of a partnership between Stanford University’s Program on Urban Studies, Youth United for Community Action, Collective Roots, Mural Music & Arts Project, Live in Peace, and the East Palo Alto Youth Action Team.

The films are an output from Urban Studies 166, 
East Palo Alto: Reading Urban Change, 
which is being co-taught by Michael Levin with Rebooting History, one of the Spatial History Project’s research groups.

In addition to the film screenings, this event will feature free food, live music, and a unique glimpse into the beauty and power of the East Palo Alto community.

Support for this project is provided by partner organizations above, as well as Stanford University affiliates including Haas Center for Public Service, Institute for Diversity in the Arts, John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities, Program on Urban Studies, School of Humanities and Sciences, Stanford Arts Institute, and the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education.
