	                	CESTA Presents: Data Visualization with Tableau – June 28	                

CESTA will supplement its busy summer season with an ongoing series of talks and mini-workshops called CESTA Presents. Each week, we’ll feature presentations by members and friends of the CESTA community. These presentations will vary in content and format, and are meant mainly as a somewhat informal exchange of information, ideas, and feedback for all lab participants, regardless of individual lab or project affiliation.

Some of the presentations will be more technical in nature, concentrating more on particular software, methods, etc., whereas other presentations will take the form of informal discussions about someone’s research. All members of the CESTA community are encouraged to attend these valuable discussions.

Our first presentation takes place this Thursday!

	                	Welcome to the new CESTA Blog!	                

Greetings everyone! We would like to officially welcome you to the new CESTA blog. This will be our new common web presence for all things CESTA. The individual labs will of course continue to maintain their own unique websites (see links on the main sidebar), but this will be the venue where we share any common information that relates to CESTA as a whole.

We will also communicate with everyone within the CESTA community via a mailing list, so be on the lookout for that as well. That mailing list and this blog are meant to work hand in hand in improving and streamlining communication among the three labs.

We’ll continue to update, expand, and tweak the site as we go, and we welcome any comments, suggestions, or questions regarding this blog or the mailing list.

The Spatial History Project’s 
A Decade of Fire in Western Australia
 has received a significant visualization update. Please check out the updated project 
here
.

Brief Project Description:

This application is based on a combination of ethnographic and ecological research undertaken by Stanford faculty and students in collaboration with Martu, Aboriginal owners of an expansive Native Title located in the Great and Little Sandy Desert bioregions of Western Australia. Ethnographic field work included interviews with Martu and quantitative observations of Martu hunting and burning. Ecological research included on-the-ground monitoring of areas at different stages of regrowth following a fire and spatial (GIS) analysis of satellite (Landsat) imagery to classify burns over a ten-year period from 2000-2010.
