This interdisciplinary collective of labs operates independently of any one particular home department, and is organizationally housed within the Dean of Research at Stanford University. CESTA labs and projects pursue research which utilize data and information visualization that span a variety of methodologies, disciplines, and departments, often collaborating with diverse team members from within the Stanford community, but also externally through national and international collaborations.",
