	                	The View and The Value: Historical Geography of Signs in San Francisco	                

Hello All,

Join me next Friday, April 12th, at 10:15 A.M. for a presentation of my senior thesis project. I will be speaking in CESTA’s Gold + Honey room, on the fourth floor of Wallenberg Hall (Bldg 160). See flyer below:

The View and The Value: 

Historical Geography of Signs in San Francisco

A senior thesis in the Department of History

[Photo: A survey from the enforcement of the 1965 Highway Beautification Act (HBA)]

My research examines signs in the public view of San Francisco, from the 1890s to the present. This curious and surprising line of local history indicates how cultural values influence the organization of space, relying upon maps identifying 
where 
and 
when 
signs have existed and textual sources that compare the laws of public versus private signage. With this case study, I hope to demonstrate the points at which property rights intersect and conflict with the freedom of speech.

During the past decade, corporate expenditures for advertising completed the shift away from print media and toward digital formats. Outdoor advertising experienced no such decline. I argue that the outdoor medium will become increasingly relevant, but the industry will become unrecognizable in the digital age. Soon, the development of virtual spaces for public and private speech will raise new questions about the management of real space. Can the ongoing controversy over online privacy inform the future of public control over open spaces? The answer requires proof that billboards create value for cities–or proof of the opposite.

Curating the Bay: Crowdsourcing a New Environmental History

April 7, 2013 – August 25, 2013

Opening Celebration, Sunday, April 7th, 4:00PM – 6:00PM

Free event, please RSVP at

.

California Historical Society is embracing 21st-century technology to celebrate the Year of the Bay in 2013, by offering its extensive collections to a crowdsourcing experiment in its gallery and at 
yearofthebay.org
.

In a year that is bringing the high-profile America’s Cup yacht races to the Bay, the opening of a new Bay Bridge span, and the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Port of San Francisco, the California Historical Society is staging an experimental exhibition of many items from its collections not publicly exhibited before. Many of these artifacts — photographs, paintings, and documents — present historical mysteries still to be solved. The historical society is welcoming the public into this rich collection of materials to contribute their own stories, knowledge, photographs, and other sources to create a richer, more diverse history of the San Francisco Bay.

The exhibition takes risks by asking visitors to fill in the blanks rather than presenting them with a finished narrative. It opens up the process of curating — usually reserved for trained professionals — to the public both in the exhibition and online as part of 
yearofthebay.org
, a dynamic crowdsourcing experiment with researchers at Stanford University and Historypin, an innovative global social technology partner.

This exhibition has been generously supported by our funding sponsors: S.D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation, Placer Partners, Port of San Francisco, and Wells Fargo. Exhibition partners include: Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis at Stanford University, EcoCenter at Heron’s Head Park, Golden Gate Audubon, Heyday, Historypin, Literacy for Environmental Justice, Port of San Francisco, San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, and San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. In-kind support is being provided by: The CBW Group, Hafner Vineyard, Herglotz Public Affairs, Lagunitas Brewing Company, and Sherwin-Williams. Institutional support to CHS is provided from the Hearst Foundation, Hewlett-Packard, The James Irvine Foundation, and San Francisco Grants for the Arts.

Premier of Three New Films to share Struggles for Environment, Justice and Community in East Palo Alto

On Monday, March 18 from 6:30 to 8:30 pm East Palo Alto youth, community organizations, and Stanford University’s Program on Urban Studies will premier 
Homegrown: Cultivating Dreams through Action – 
three unique hip hop documentary films highlighting powerful stories from East Palo Alto. This free, community event will take place in East Palo Alto City Hall, 2145 University Ave.

The films merge hip hop music video and historical documentary approaches and are a product of a unique ten week collaboration between Stanford Urban Studies students and East Palo Alto youth lyricists. Coming together as part of a class about EPA environmental issues, the teams of Stanford students and youth lyricists partnered to edit films and create sound tracks that tell three important stories in a fresh new way:

Youth United for Community Action’s (YUCAs) campaign to close the Romic hazardous wastes recycling in an effort lasting nearly a decade and leading to state action to close the plant forever

Peoples’ irrepressible desire to farm the land in East Palo Alto, and cross race, culture and time in the effort to grow their own local food -  from a time when African American community activists farmed the “Back 40” to today’s efforts by Collective Roots.

The Weeks Neighborhood Plan and East Palo Alto Historical and Agricultural Society’s vision to use the plentiful land to build self-sufficiency and community through a locally-based food system.

Films are a product of a partnership between Stanford University’s Program on Urban Studies, Youth United for Community Action, Collective Roots, Mural Music & Arts Project, Live in Peace, and the East Palo Alto Youth Action Team.

The films are an output from Urban Studies 166, 
East Palo Alto: Reading Urban Change, 
which is being co-taught by Michael Levin with Rebooting History, one of the Spatial History Project’s research groups.

In addition to the film screenings, this event will feature free food, live music, and a unique glimpse into the beauty and power of the East Palo Alto community.

Support for this project is provided by partner organizations above, as well as Stanford University affiliates including Haas Center for Public Service, Institute for Diversity in the Arts, John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities, Program on Urban Studies, School of Humanities and Sciences, Stanford Arts Institute, and the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education.

Please join Visualizing Complexity & Uncertainty 
next Thursday, March 7 at Noon
, in Wallenberg Hall for the third talk of our winter series.

Reviel Netz 
– Professor of Classics and, by courtesy, Philosophy (Stanford) — will present 
“
Making Sense of Greek Culture: Maps, Numbers, Thoughts”

Description:

In my presentation I try to do two things: share my recent research into the geographical patterns of Greek cultural life, and reflect on the quasi-statistical, vaguely quantitative, “methodology” typical to much of my work. In between the Digital Humanities, on the one hand, and the traditional philologist’s close reading, on the other hand, there lies a region of small samples, studied by hand – where the sensibility of the scholar can dwell on the detail of data.

Thursday, March 7, 12:00 pm

“Gold n Honey” meeting space, 4th floor of Wallenberg Hall (bldg. 160) — (Please note the change from our regular venue; the elevator will be open.)

Lunch will be served.

We hope to see you there!

	                	CESTA Presents: Matteo Lorenzini and Mark Philipson – Friday March 1st	                

Greetings,

You are invited to the following back-to-back presentations this 
Friday, March 1st, in CESTA:

Predictive Models and Semantic Representation of Archaeological Datasets: The Case of the Alghero district, Sardinia (Italy).

Matteo Lorenzini

11:30am-12:15pm

One of the most important characteristics of research about the archaeological landscape is the definition of a global approach to the analysis of formative processes, i.e. the different anthropic and natural traces that have contributed to the making of a particular landscape context. The refinement of the methodology applied to landscape analysis has brought to a rapid increase in the predictive analysis of both the archaeological landscape and the geographic distributions of archaeological evidences, through the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. My talk will introduce a case study in the landscape analysis of the Alghero district in Sardinia (Italy).

This district is being studied since the 19th century and, currently, is the object of research of the University of Sassari and the Archaeological Superintendence of Sassari. The analysis takes into consideration different settlement dynamics and environmental markers that characterized human settlements from the prehistorical age to late medieval period.

My approach integrates geo-statistical analysis with the semantic representation of archaeological evidences. Distributive and predictive models are being created in a GIS open source platform that integrates the Maximum Entropy algorithm (MAXENT) and the R statistical package with GRASS GIS. In addition, my work researches on the semantic representation of archaeological features as a crucial component in landscape analysis. This kind of representation will be modeled in the Geographical Information System together with the spatial component in order to connect the local database with external sources, offering additional data for landscape analysis.

Mediathread

Mark Philipson

12:30 – 1:15pm

Mediathread is an open-source platform for exploration, analysis, and organization of web-based multimedia content.

Mediathread connects to a variety of image and video collections (such as YouTube, Flickr, library databases, and course libraries), enabling users to lift items out of these collections and into an analysis environment. In Mediathread, items can then be clipped, annotated, organized, and embedded into essays and other written analysis.

More details can be found at

Presentations will take place in CESTA on the fourth floor of Wallenberg Hall (Building 160). Lunch will be provided.

	                	Press Release: Erik Steiner and Spatial History Project Participates in National “Designing Ingelligent Environments” Workshop	                

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

National “Designing Intelligent Environments” workshop demonstrates value of smart technologies in creating sustainable built environments

Spotsylvania County, Virginia —February 27, 2013—The National Academy of Environmental Design and the National Building Museum co-hosted the workshop “Designing Intelligent Environments, Social and Ethical Implications” to explore the exploding role of new technologies in shaping the built environment.  Leaders from across North America convened at the National Building Museum to present emerging digital-physical interfaces.  
Speakers included Erik Steiner of the Stanford History Project
; Andrew Turner from the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI); Anijo Matthew from the IIT Institute of Design; Kathleen Harder from the University of Minnesota; Michelle Cullen from IBM; and Eduard Epp from the University of Manitoba.

The keynote speaker was Washington DC Chief of Police Cathy Lanier, whose research-to-practice presentation demonstrated the reality of “on the ground decision making” using design thinking to benefit safety and social benefit for the Capitol’s residents, national and international visitors.

Dr. Fritz Steiner, President of the National Academy and Dean of the School of Architecture at UT Austin explained, “The workshop yielded new insights into how smarter data can help designers craft more sustainable urban environments, how new technologies are affecting our personal space, and how intelligent environment technologies are enabling designers and planners to be more responsive to societal needs. Such technologies are changing how we communicate, how we visualize our surroundings, how we make decisions, how we design and plan, and how we interrelate with our environments–both real and virtual.”

Dr. Jim Wescoat, Co-Director of the National Academy’s Research Committee, and Aga Khan Professor of Landscape Architecture at MIT said, “One fascinating aspect of the workshop was the emerging role of new technologies in place-making and community building.  These promising possibilities were reinforced by studies of historical environments in the digital humanities field, and discussions of the history of intelligent, even wise, environments.”

The National Academy of Environmental Design serves the public by promoting the flourishing of individuals, communities, and the natural world through the sustainable design and stewardship of human and natural environments.  The National Building Museum is America’s leading cultural institution devoted to the history and impact of the built environment. Its mission is to advance the quality of the built environment by educating people about its impact on their lives.
