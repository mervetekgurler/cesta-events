	                	CESTA/Spatial History Project is Hiring Undergraduate Research Assistants for Winter Quarter	                </a></h2>
	            <p>The Spatial History Project within the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) at Stanford seeks to hire undergraduate Research Assistants to work on a variety of digital projects based in humanities scholarship at the nexus of history, English, art, and geography. We seek students who bring practical knowledge or interest in information design and the development of interactive visualization tools for humanities research.</p>
<ul>
<li>Successful candidates will have a strong background or interest in learning in any of the following areas:</li>
<li>Information visualization and design (e.g. graphic design, cartography, programming, interaction design</li>
<li>Adobe CS, JavaScript, ActionScript d3, etc)</li>
<li>Spatial and network analysis (GIS, Tableau, Gephi, etc)</li>
<li>Archival research, data analysis, database creation and management</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of possible projects that new research assistants could be involved are:</p>
<p><strong>Living with the Railroads</strong><br/>
Following the work of Richard White, Living with the Railroads seeks to use crowdsourcing to learn more about the social, cultural, and environmental impact of the development and expansion of the railroads in the American West, and hopefully eventually across the United States. The goal, in conjunction with Historypin, is to get railroad enthusiasts to upload their data, identify images and documents whose provenance is unknown, and help facilitate the growth of connections between enthusiast and enthusiast communities, while at the same time collecting metadata on these images.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese Railroad Workers</strong><br/>
Faculty Gordon Chang (History) and Shelley Fisher Fishkin (English) are leading this project to unearth the undocumented history of the Chinese workers who constructed the U.S. transcontinental railroad in the late 1860s. This project seeks to discover and present this missing history from many different sources. Participants from a wide range of backgrounds, disciplines, and locations are working together to piece this history together.</p>
<p><strong>Geography of the Post</strong><br/>
From the end of the Civil War until the close of the nineteenth century, the United States Postal System grew into a vast communications network. The Post was one of the century&#8217;s largest spatial systems, with more than 75,000 offices connecting communities scattered across the continent. Geography of the Post maps this behemoth network on its western periphery: where it spread, how it operated, and its role in shaping the space and place of the region.</p>
<p><strong>The Law of the Antebellum Frontier</strong><br/>
Innovative digital research technologies allow us to look at the expansion of the American nation during the critical years before the Civil War in new ways.</p>
<p><strong>A Microhistory of the Great Migration The Great Migration</strong> was a watershed in African American life: over the course of six decades (1910-1970), six million black southerners left the South in search of more meaningful experiences of freedom. This project hopes to offer a different angle of vision on the migration by bringing to light the places where migrants slept, ate, got haircuts, and danced along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Rebooting History</strong><br/>
This project is an exploration with a point of origin in how regional utilization of East Palo Alto&#8217;s space helped set the stage for a dynamic of inequality between the community and what would become Silicon Valley.</p>

	                	CESTA Presents Christopher Richard &#8211; Myth Busting the Founding of San Francisco &#8211; Dec. 2nd @ Noon	                </a></h2>
	            <p><span><strong>Myth Busting the Founding of San Francisco – The Anza Expedition and the Role of Aquatic Habitats in the Siteing of Mission Dolores</strong></span></p>
<p>Monday, December 2nd @ Noon<br/>
Rm. 433A, Fourth Floor of Wallenberg Hall</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Juan Bautista de Anza chose the locations for the mission and presidio in San Francisco in March 1776. Anza and his chaplain, Fr. Font, spent three days analyzing the agricultural and strategic potential of the various neighborhoods of San Francisco before siteing the mission and presidio. They gave the name <em>Dolors </em>to the water supply that they expected to provide for agriculture at the mission. Three months later when the settlers arrived, the writings of the pastor, Fr. Palou, reinterpreted the water feature named Dolores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">This engendered a long-standing controversy about the pre-European terrain of San Francisco, the analysis of which touches upon tales which, while incorrect, are held as legend. This adds an epistemological challenge to righting the record, not present in most presentations of research. In this case, the first-person journals were detailed, sophisticated, and in agreement, however challenged in narrative structure. The controversy is largely traceable to a mis-translation/interpretation in the 1860s, which blossomed into controversy at the centennial in 1876, and which is hotly contested to this day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">A succession of maps from the Land-Case collection at the Bancroft Library, newly brought into the discussion, along with the extreme geomorphic unlikelihood of the legendary version, make a clear case for a revised history of the event and terrain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Christopher Richard is a recently retired curator of aquatic biology at Oakland Museum of California. During 30 years at the museum he curated two major permanent gallery expansions and a dozen temporary exhibitions. The majority of his research was heading a team mapping the modern and historic hydrology of urbanized portions of the S.F. Bay Area, resulting in 15 published maps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> Since 2006, he has been studying the records of the Anza expeditions to California in the 1770s. These provide valuable baseline descriptions of aquatic habitats prior to significant modification by European influence. He is in the process of revisiting all the sites described by Anza to determine the relative health of the remaining aquatic habitats.<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><br/>

<p>The Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis will host the next Hestia2 event November 4-5 in Wallenberg Hall at Stanford University. During this one and one half day seminar we will explore network analysis and uncertainty in data from a number of different perspectives. It will also be an unveiling of a number of new projects.</p>
<p>On the first day, beginning at noon, we will learn about data intelligence based on work done at Quid, a data analytics software company based in San Francisco. Then Walter Scheidel and Elijah Meeks will present Orbis 2.0, and Dennis Wuthrich of Farallon will share Arches, a new open-source geospatial software system for cultural heritage inventory and management.</p>
<p>The second full program day will include a presentation from the Stanford Literary Lab on Network Theory and Dramatic Structure, comparing dramatic networks in plays from ancient Greece and Rome, Renaissance England and France, 18th-century Germany, and 19th-century Norway. And we’ll have a lunchtime talk on the geography of digestion and a geography of medical body sensors by Nick Bauch followed by a tour of networks in digital maps by Stanford’s Digital and Rare Maps Librarian.</p>
<p>There will also be two workshops with an opportunity for deeper engagement with new tools: Nicole Coleman and Giorgio Caviglia (DensityDesign) will offer a workshop on Palladio, a new platform for visualization of historical data. And Karl Grossner and Elijah Meeks will offer a workshop on Topotime, a new data model and graphical layout they have been working on that is designed to handle fuzzy temporal bounds and cyclical time from.</p>
<p>Both days will include early evening receptions in the newly renovated CESTA workspace in Wallenberg Hall with large-screen displays of work presented during the conference as well as new digital humanities work going on at CESTA and the Stanford University Libraries.</p>

<div></div>
<div>Nicholas Jenkins, Elijah Meeks and Scott Murray will present their work on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223806/http://kindred.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"><em>Kindred Britain</em></a>, a new Stanford digital humanities website, published by Stanford University Libraries.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This interactive site presents a vision of British culture and history seen through the lens of family ties. <em>Kindred Britain </em>is built on a customized database of nearly 30,000 individuals who either are British or have a familial relationship to a British person. Records in the database span the last 15 centuries and include the noteworthy and the notorious – from prime ministers, novelists and scientists to lunatics, misfits and criminals. Kindred Britain can show a family link between any two people in the database. The site can quickly diagram how a monarch connects to a sea captain, a composer to a squire, a diarist to a doctor, a poet to a banker.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Jenkins, Meeks and Murray will talk about the process of creating <em>Kindred Britain</em>, about the site&#8217;s technical and design architecture, about <em>Kindred Britain</em>&#8216;s place in the landscape of digital humanities projects and about the possibilities for intersections between humanities scholarship and the web.</div>

<h2>Stanford digital humanities researchers receive NEH grant</h2>

<p>A grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) will enable Stanford researchers to develop a suite of network visualization tools specifically designed for humanities research.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223806/http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/people/index.html">DAN EDELSTEIN</a></strong>, an associate professor of French, and history Professor <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223806/http://history.stanford.edu/findlen_paula">PAULA FINDLEN</a></strong> are the principal investigators of “Networks in History,” which was awarded nearly $300,000 from the NEH.</p>
<p>The grant will allow Edelstein, Findlen and their colleagues to build on visualization tools they developed for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223806/http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/">Mapping the Republic of Letters</a>, a Stanford digital humanities endeavor that is using technology to analyze the circulation of people, letters and objects during the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>
<p>Drawing from an array of digitized materials from the Stanford University Libraries, Oxford University, Bibliotheque National de France, Centre National de la Recherché Scientifique and other archives around the globe, Mapping the Republic of Letters projects have given scholars new perspectives on the social networks that connected the intellectuals of the European Enlightenment.</p>
<p>A scholar of 18th-century French history and literature, Edelstein has been using metadata provided by the Electronic Enlightenment Project at Oxford University to situate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223806/http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/casestudies/voltaire/index.html">Voltaire’s correspondence network</a> within the broader Enlightenment Republic of Letters.</p>
<p>However, as Findlen, Edelstein and other humanities scholars experimented with the data through a range of case studies, including interactive visual representations of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223806/http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/casestudies/franklin/index.html">Benjamin Franklin</a>’s and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223806/http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/casestudies/locke/index.html">John Locke</a>’s social networks, they discovered the tools were lacking.</p>
<p>“Almost all of the data visualization tools that are currently available have been designed with modern data sets in mind,” Edelstein said. Existing tools, such as those for statistical, literary and spatial analysis, “don’t work well for historical data, which tends to be messy and incomplete,” he added.</p>
<p><strong>NICOLE COLEMAN</strong>, the academic technology specialist who contributed to the development of each of the Mapping the Republic of Letters case studies, said that as she and the researchers built those visualizations they didn’t realize they were at the “beginning of a deep exploration of how to use graphical interfaces for humanistic inquiry.”</p>
<p><strong>Customized tools</strong></p>
<p>For example, to explore travel on the famed Grand Tour, the team created an interactive version of Joseph Priestley’s<em> A Chart of Biography. </em>Written in 1765, it traces significant figures throughout history and is one the earliest such timelines. With the digital version, scholars can pan and zoom, click through layers of information, and sort and filter according to any number of attributes associated with individuals represented in the database.</p>
<p>Traditional computational visualization formats, like graphs, bar charts and scatterplots, can be abstract, but Coleman said customized tools contextualize fragmentary information and “make visible possible connections that are not otherwise in the data.”</p>
<p>With this more nuanced representation of the data, the researchers “will be able to map not just the exchange of letters, but any type of location-associated data like place of birth, place of publication, travel, etc.,” Coleman said.</p>
<p>The specialized suite of tools will be designed “so that anyone interested in history can easily use them,” said Edelstein. Open source modules, or “widgets,” will benefit all walks of researchers, from amateur historians to high school students, though Edelstein noted that scholars working on the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment “will probably benefit the most from this work, since they can use the tools as well as the data, and even upload data sets of their own.”</p>

She has been assembling a meticulous portrait of conservation lands in California: lands that – since the early 19th century – have been set aside for habitat conservation, recreation and other purposes. They range in size from sprawling county, state and national parks like Yosemite to parcels as small as city parks. In all, Santos has collected information on over 53,000 open space properties across the state.</p>
<p>Collecting this information is vital to understanding the effectiveness of past conservation efforts, and guiding future conservation in an era of environmental change. Among the questions that Santos is posing:</p>
<ul>
<li>How has land cover inside those lands changed since they were established?</li>
<li>How successful were they in conserving the natural resources and species for which they were intended?</li>
</ul>
<p>The general public can now help out in this task, thanks to an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223806/http://websites.greeninfo.org/mapcollaborator/cpad_dates/">online crowdsourcing tool</a> Santos developed in collaboration with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223806/http://greeninfo.org/">Greeninfo Network</a>. The single most important metric Santos is seeking? <strong>The establishment date of each conserved area</strong>, which users can submit using a range of precision, namely the <strong>exact year</strong>, <strong>or a range of years</strong> within which they understand it was established.</p>
<p>In addition, users are welcome to share notes, observations and other experiences related to these properties.</p>
<p>Further instructions on using the tool are available after the Read More link.</p>

<div><strong>Instructions on using the tool:</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>Using the application should be pretty straightforward.</div>
<ul>
<li>Click anywhere on the map for a popup of the current dates data we have for a unit and holding.</li>
<li>On the right, you can change base layers, toggle overlays, and create a permalink to your current map view.</li>
<li>Using the options on the left, you can search parks by location or agency, select units or holdings to update their establishment or acquisition dates, attach notes to the map, and upload shapefiles or KMLs.</li>
</ul>

<div><strong>Dealing with uncertainty, instability and uniqueness: designers as (digital) reflective practitioners</strong></p>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Description</strong></div>
<div>The<strong> </strong>notion of designers as ‘reflective practitioners’ has been proposed by Donald Schön more than thirty years ago, to describe a specific way of knowing that is grounded in making and in a continuos conversation with the material of a design situation. More than starting from abstract planning, designers move through improvised actions and moment-by-moment responses to immediate needs and contexts. This idea of reflection-in-action represents a powerful tool for understanding, criticizing restructuring and acting within situations of<strong> </strong>uncertainty, complexity and value conflicts. Is it possible (and useful) to bring this notion of design-reasoning<strong> </strong>within humanities contexts? And in such a perspective, which can be the<strong> </strong>role of designers, visualizations and interfaces?</div>
<div></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Bio</strong></div>
<div>After receiving his PhD in Design at the Politecnico di Milano in 2013, Giorgio Caviglia is currently a postdoc at the DensityDesign Lab (Politecnico di Milano). His research stems from the intersection of Design and Digital Humanities: in particular, he is interested in deepening the relationships between designers, scholars and computer scientists in the definition of new humanities research methods and tools based on digital environments and data. Working on the design and the development of visualizations and interfaces for years, his work has been presented in numerous exhibitions and publications, including MediaLAB Prado, SIGGRAPH, MIT HyperStudio, Data Flow, Malofiej, Visual Complexity.</div>
