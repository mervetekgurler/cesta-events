Apply by: Position will remain open until filled.<br/>
Organization: Stanford University, Branner Earth Sciences Library<br/>
Responsible to: Geospatial Manager</p>
<p>General description<br/>
The Stanford University Libraries seek an inspirational and enthusiastic individual to serve as the Geospatial Instruction and Reference Specialist. In support of campus research and instructional needs, the Geospatial Instruction and Reference Specialist designs and delivers instruction to geospatial users, assisting with the integration of geospatial skills into the curriculum. She/he will work closely with the Geospatial Manager to run the wide-ranging geospatial workshops covering both propriety and open source software. The Specialist will also manage and coordinate the hourly staff handling the bulk of reference questions asked by the users, taking on the more challenging questions as need be.</p>
<p>Responsibilities include planning, scheduling, and teaching Geospatial workshops; providing excellent reference service face to face and online; preparing workshop materials, web pages, and handouts; and providing outreach services to the Stanford community.</p>
<p>The Geospatial Instruction and Reference Specialist is a member of the Science and Engineering Resource Group (SERG) of the Stanford University Libraries (SUL). Together with the Geospatial Manager, this position sustains and strengthens the GIS program as the primary provider of GIS-based services, research consultation, and user education to Stanford University (SU) students, faculty and staff from all departments across campus.</p>
<p>This position is based in the Branner Earth Sciences Library, but the Geospatial Instruction and Reference Specialist collaborates with and provides support to all users interested in geospatial education across the campus. Since s/he will provide geospatial support to users from a wide-range of academic disciplines (Earth Sciences to History to Epidemiology) the ideal candidate will have demonstrable experience in applying GIS methods to a variety of disciplines.</p>
<p>Specific Duties and Responsibilities<br/>

<p>Please join us this Thursday for our next CESTA Presents event:</p>
<p><strong>Javascript InfoViz Library D3</strong><br/>
<strong>Elijah Meeks, Digital Humanities Specialist, Stanford</strong><br/>
<strong>Thursday, July 19th @ Noon</strong><br/>

<p><strong>Javascript InfoViz Library 3D<br/>
</strong></p>
<p>D3 is a JavaScript information visualization library that relies on scalable vector graphics (SVG) to display interactive and dynamic content. D3 is a robust framework that not only allows for traditional plots of categorical and quantitative information, but also the display of geospatial and network data. This presentation will touch on the data formats commonly used for D3 such as JSON and GeoJSON, the general structure of how D3 processes data and interaction events, performance and compatibility issues, and resources to learn D3.</p>
<p>The following sites provide an overview of D3, as well as examples and tutorials:<br/>

<p>Please join us this Thursday for our next CESTA Presents event:</p>
<p><strong>Storyboarding Visualizations</strong><br/>
<strong>Fred Freitas, Dept. of History at Stanford</strong><br/>
<strong>Thursday, July 12th @ Noon</strong><br/>

<p><strong>Storyboarding Visualizations</strong></p>
<p>Storyboarding is an exercise that helps the organization of a visual argument and the definition of the user interactions that are part of a visualization. Fred Freitas will be presenting a workshop on storyboarding as a tool to think through the workflow of creating visualizations and to define the dimensions of the final design. These dimensions include: the purpose of a visualization, the desired functionality, the properties of individual elements of the display, and the composition of the elements into a usable application.</p>

<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>We are pleased to be hosting a summer workshop introducing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120721195808/http://gephi.org/" target="_blank">Gephi</a>, an open source spatial analysis and network visualization software, with Elijah Meeks, the Digital Humanities Specialist at Stanford University.  See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120721195808/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Wo22jl4Ac&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">this video</a> for an example of Gephi being used to track how Wikipedia was edited during the recent revolutions in the Arab World.</p>
<p>The Gephi workshop will be Wednesday, July 11, from 1pm to 4pm in 124 Mulford Hall. If you are interested in attending the workshop, please write to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120721195808/mailto:dhc-history@berkeley.edu" target="_blank">dhc-history@berkeley.edu</a>.<br/>

	            <p>CESTA will supplement its busy summer season with an ongoing series of talks and mini-workshops called CESTA Presents. Each week, we&#8217;ll feature presentations by members and friends of the CESTA community. These presentations will vary in content and format, and are meant mainly as a somewhat informal exchange of information, ideas, and feedback for all lab participants, regardless of individual lab or project affiliation.</p>
<p>Some of the presentations will be more technical in nature, concentrating more on particular software, methods, etc., whereas other presentations will take the form of informal discussions about someone&#8217;s research. All members of the CESTA community are encouraged to attend these valuable discussions.</p>
<p>Our first presentation takes place this Thursday!</p>
<p><strong>Data Visualization with Tableau</strong><br/>

	            <p>Greetings everyone! We would like to officially welcome you to the new CESTA blog. This will be our new common web presence for all things CESTA. The individual labs will of course continue to maintain their own unique websites (see links on the main sidebar), but this will be the venue where we share any common information that relates to CESTA as a whole.</p>
<p>We will also communicate with everyone within the CESTA community via a mailing list, so be on the lookout for that as well. That mailing list and this blog are meant to work hand in hand in improving and streamlining communication among the three labs.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll continue to update, expand, and tweak the site as we go, and we welcome any comments, suggestions, or questions regarding this blog or the mailing list.</p>

	            <p>The Spatial History Project&#8217;s <em>A Decade of Fire in Western Australia</em> has received a significant visualization update. Please check out the updated project <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120721195808/http://www.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/viz.php?id=395&amp;project_id=">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Brief Project Description:</strong></p>
<p><em>This application is based on a combination of ethnographic and ecological research undertaken by Stanford faculty and students in collaboration with Martu, Aboriginal owners of an expansive Native Title located in the Great and Little Sandy Desert bioregions of Western Australia. Ethnographic field work included interviews with Martu and quantitative observations of Martu hunting and burning. Ecological research included on-the-ground monitoring of areas at different stages of regrowth following a fire and spatial (GIS) analysis of satellite (Landsat) imagery to classify burns over a ten-year period from 2000-2010.</em></p>
