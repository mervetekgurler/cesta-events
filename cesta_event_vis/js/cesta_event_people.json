Contemporary ideas such as \u201cpolitical justice,\u201d or \u201chuman rights,\u201d not only appeared in the conceptual framework of eighteenth-century political, social, or philosophical theory, but the terms themselves also became part of the cultural lexicon. These compound concepts, in which two pre-existing terms are brought together into a new configuration with a single, stable meaning, form a critical backbone of eighteenth-century thought.",

Every format has its own strategies for truthfulness of representation and for signaling interpretive norms.

With regard to spatial metaphors, cognitive literary scholars have shown that variants of cardiocentrism \u2013 the notion that the heart is the center of cognition and emotional life \u2013 originated independently in multiple cultures, thus confirming the internalist intuition. By contrast, the distributed view of cognition holds that the mind \u201cextends beyond the skin\u201d and emphasizes the social, dispersed, and external nature of emotions.",
