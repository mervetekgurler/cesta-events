1528221_cesta-newsletter-spring-2016.txt_1,CESTA Welcomes New Director,"CESTA is very excited to share the big news about the arrival of our new Director, Elaine Treharne, as of June 1. Welcome Elaine!

From the New Director:
It is with great pleasure that I take up the role of CESTA Director, after Zephyr Frank’s founding of the Center. Zephyr has built an extraordinary enterprise, characterized by dynamism, generosity, and innovation. Under his leadership, CESTA has pioneered Digital Humanities research and teaching at Stanford, and become a flagship initiative for DH globally. Dozens of exciting projects are currently hosted by CESTA, either as the funded research of individual scholars and groups, or the work of the pillar projects: Spatial History; Poetic Media; the Literary Lab; and Humanities+Design. A Certificate in DH for graduates, a DH Minor for undergraduates, Graduate Fellowships, and Undergraduate Research Assistants combine CESTA’s research with cutting-edge teaching and training. Collaborators come from all over the world to work with colleagues in CESTA, and the Center's reputation only serves to underscore its vibrancy and many successes to date.

Under my new Directorship, I’m hopeful that CESTA can expand its activities, particularly in the provision of DH teaching and research support; we’re hopeful of obtaining large grants to consolidate and enhance our spatial, textual, and cultural heritage research. We’ll welcome scholars from around the world, and hope to set up a variety of schemes that seek to facilitate the work, especially, of early careers academics. These are exciting times for Digital Humanities, and CESTA is well-positioned to set the agenda from its position of internationally renowned excellence
.

A Big Thank You to Our Departing Director:
Zephyr will be on leave from teaching and administration during the coming academic year as a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences. His current research involves the long history of melodrama as a form of social commentary in Brazil. Starting with nineteenth-century stage plays, his research will extend to popular films of the 1950s and the contemporary manifestation of melodrama in Brazilian telenovelas. Zephyr will maintain a presence in CESTA as the director of the Spatial History Project as he continues this work. We collectively send a very big thank you, Zephyr, for all of your hard work, vision, and perseverance! and we wish you the best on a much deserved break!"
1528221_cesta-newsletter-spring-2016.txt_2,CESTA Establishes New Center Manager Position!,"We are very excited to announce that CESTA has established its first official Manager position, to be held by Celena Allen as of June 1st. This is a significant achievement in CESTA's trajectory and growth, and thanks to everyone who made this possible. To date, this role has been an ad-hoc, general administrator role but now the position is recognized as official by the university, helping to consolidate CESTA’s provision and resource for faculty and student participants. CESTA is very lucky to have Celena as the first postholder, and we wish her the very best.

From the New Center Manager:
I would like to express my gratitude and excitement in taking on this new role in CESTA. A heartfelt thank you goes to both Matt Bryant and Zephyr Frank for their leadership, guidance and support throughout the years. I am very fortunate to work alongside an incredible group of colleagues and scholars continually pushing the bounds. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed working closely with the Spatial History Project and I look forward to extending my work across CESTA under Elaine’s direction."
1528221_cesta-newsletter-spring-2016.txt_3,Enchanting the Desert Launches,"In May the project Enchanting the Desert was formally published, and publicly released by Stanford University Press.  Project lead Nicholas Bauch has been working on Enchanting the Desert with colleagues around CESTA and the Bill Lane Center for the American West, along with the University Press editors, since 2012.

The publication of Enchanting the Desert marked the opening of Stanford University Press' digital publishing initiative, which peer-reviews, markets, and maintains born-digital scholarship in the same way it would treat a print monograph. The Press held a live-streamed launch event at the Rumsey Map Center on the Stanford campus; Nick and SUP discussed the culmination of years of work that SUP director Alan Harvey said embodies the Press’ hopes for its digital initiative going forward. Many sincere thank you's to all involved over the years!

The project’s lead programmer, Delenn Chin, will be taking a break from digital humanities while she heads off to Edinburgh, Scotland this summer to study artificial intelligence. Delenn has been an invaluable member of the project since her freshman year in 2014.

You can explore the project at Enchanting the Desert: A Pattern Language for the Production of Space (http://enchantingthedesert.com/home/) , as well as visit Enchanting the Desert on Stanford University Press (http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=25726)  and the Spatial History Project (http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/project.php?id=1061) . The launch event (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIpZWxFB0E4)  is also recorded online."
1528221_cesta-newsletter-spring-2016.txt_4,DH Asia Wraps Up First Year,"The DHAsia series continued this spring as scholars working at the intersection of digital humanities and Asian Studies visited CESTA to lecture and lead workshops. Stay tuned for next year's DHAsia residencies!
RICHARD HOYT LONG AND JEAN SO

In March, Richard Jean So and Hoyt Long from the University of Chicago gave the lecture ""Narrative as Algorithm: A Macroanalysis of Japanese and Chinese Texts."" They built on their talk with a workshop on ""text mining for humanists."" After choosing to work with either Japanese or Chinese, workshop participants learned how to analyze their documents with techniques like MDW (“most distinctive word""), which allows the extraction of words most characteristic of a group of texts. By the end of the session, everyone had created their own visualization of the “distance” between different works of literature.


HILDE DE WEERT

Hilde De Weert, professor at Leiden University, used her public lecture “Digital Perspectives on Imperial Chinese Political History” to discuss shifts in 12th century Chinese political communication, and to explain how she used old notebooks and letters to reconstruct the informal networks that shaped the country's political history. Hilde created an automatic system to mine classical Chinese texts for data, tagging documents’ references to people, places, and bureaucratic offices which can then be compared with other databases. In her workshop, she led a full room through two online platforms, Markus and Visus, that she designed with colleague Brent Ho to help scholars in the Chinese humanities link and visualize their data.

Hilde created Markus (http://dh.chinese-empires.eu/beta/) after realizing that manually annotating information in her texts was inefficient and not very user-friendly; Markus both automatically tags and lets researchers tag their own customized keywords, even helping to identify important words based on one’s interest. The result: a database of information that can then be explored graphically through Visus.

JAVIER CHA

CESTA welcomed Javier Cha from the University of Hong Kong as DHAsia’s penultimate visiting scholar. Javier discussed his research into the social environment and literary world of early Korea's ""yangban"" elite class, based on big-picture data-- from hundreds of literary texts, to family networks with thousands of nodes reconstructed from tombstones. Javier presented his computational analysis after introducing the broad concepts at play (“I’m an intellectual historian and I have to explain ideas first,” he said). Javier’s investigations began with the larger question of Confucianism’s development in Korea: why did Korea become a Confucian country some time between 1100 and 1500? A simple question, he reflected, “but simple questions tend to be the most complicated.” Javier's workshop expanded on his research methods, focusing on Cytoscape as a tool for genealogical analysis.
KRIS MANJAPRA

The very last DHAsia talk of this academic year featured Tufts University professor Kris Manjapra, who discussed his work at the intersection of oral history, digital humanities, and postcolonial studies in “The Visualization of Voice: Bengali Intellectuals in the Age of Decolonization, 1950-1980.”

Over the past 10 years, Kris has collected 70 oral histories that he says provide ""a bird’s eye view of the social relations embedded within"
1528221_cesta-newsletter-spring-2016.txt_5,the documents,".” Describing his process, Kris emphasized the importance of intimacy in this particularly interpersonal form of archiving, and discussed how network analysis gave him the “preparatory vision… for a more traditional historian’s work of interpretation.”  Kris followed his talk with the workshop ""The Curation of Voice: Enhancing Search, Discovery, and Content Structure in Oral History Collections."""
1528221_cesta-newsletter-spring-2016.txt_6,"Humanities + Design Aids Panama Papers Investigations, Wins ACLS Grant","You’ve probably heard of the Panama Papers, millions of leaked financial documents that have made countless headlines over the last few months. But you might not know that the tool that the International Consortium of Journalists (ICIJ) used to discover connections within this huge data trove originated in CESTA”s very own Humanities + Design lab. ICIJ reporters used the software “Linkurious (http://linkurio.us/#sthash.WhIBdf6U.dpuf) ,” which grew out of “Knot (http://knot-dev.herokuapp.com/investigate.html#sthash.WhIBdf6U.dpuf) ,” a data visualization tool built in collaboration with Sebastian Heymann and DensityDesign that developed during the August 2012 workshop Early Modern Time and Networks.

Stanford Libraries (http://library.stanford.edu/blogs/stanford-libraries-blog/2016/04/software-developed-stanford-helps-uncover-connections-panama) reports:

“Historians and journalists both work with incomplete, heterogeneous data sets and need tools to help them piece together a narrative based on fragmentary evidence. Knot is an example of injecting humanistic method into technology to help make sense of complex relationships-- In this case, the people and organizations behind more than 11.5 million financial and legal records.”

The H+D lab’s next phase of research along the lines of “Knot” is “Fibra,” which seeks to augment research through a graph modeling interface enriched by access to Linked Data. Fibra was one of just five projects from a pool of over 90 applications to receive a Digital Humanities Extension grant from the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS); the grant will fund the project from July 1, 2016 to December of 2017 under the leadership of P.I.s Dan Edelstein and Nicole Coleman, who is also project director. H+D will work on Fibra with the Semantic Computing Group at Aalto, Finland and with Stanford University Libraries."
1528221_cesta-newsletter-spring-2016.txt_7,CESTA at the Rumsey Map Center Opening,"Members of CESTA helped celebrate the April opening of the incredible new David Rumsey Map Center (https://www.facebook.com/rumseymapcenter/) with presentations on their own map-related work. The Map Center's launch in Green Library unveiled a new collection of 150,000 pieces donated by David Rumsey to create a wealth of resources that Stanford Libraries calls “unparalleled on the West Coast.”

As part of the celebrations, Zephyr Frank led “Historical Maps and Economic Histories,” using his Rio de Janeiro research to demonstrate the possibilities of spatial data and ""visual arguments.""  One visualization, for example, depicted the slave market in Rio: it captured the movement of people across the city in order to demonstrate just how ubiquitous slavery was throughout the area and to ground large-scale analysis in personal experiences, attaching each data point to names and real circumstances in recognition of individual lives.

CESTA also gave a broad overview of its work. Celena Allen introduced CESTA as a collaborative digital humanities space, then turned the mic over to Richard White, Ryan Heuser, and Nick Bauch, who discussed their own projects from the Spatial History Project and the Literary Lab. All three shared how maps and spatial data opened up new and exciting research for them-- and even how, in Richard’s words, they “allowed me to do some of the best teaching I’ve ever done in my life."""
1528221_cesta-newsletter-spring-2016.txt_8,DH Workshops,"Ian Gregory on GIS mapping


Ian Gregory, Professor of Digital Humanities at Lancaster University, visited CESTA for an open discussion on GIS mapping and its applications to historical and literary analysis. Among other topics, Ian explained how he and fellow researchers explored language and place. Starting from an argument the poet Coleridge once had with a stranger about the proper way to describe a waterfall (“Beautiful”? “Majestic”? “Sublime”?), his group analyzed literary descriptions of the Lake District (http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/mappingthelakes/index.htm)  to find word ""hotspots"" and broad patterns.
Ben Adams on Frankenplace


The “Ad Hoc Mapping and Geography Group” met to hear University of Auckland’s Ben Adams discuss his tool ""Frankenplace,"" which maps places referenced in conjunction with particular search queries for an interactive, thematic way to organize and visualize information: http://frankenplace.com/. The application currently runs against Wikipedia and travel blog entires, but can be adapted to any corpus.

DH for Undergraduates

In May, staff at CESTA joined forces for a session of ""lightning talks"" introducing undergrads to the world of digital humanities, with a broad overview, an intro to DH tools such as Palladio, and a sampling of DH projects from the Poetic Media Lab and the Literary Lab. Even Research Assistants who work in CESTA on a daily basis enjoyed getting a broader taste of the programs, tools, and projects that DH has to offer. After hearing about Lacuna, one RA even asked how he could use it on his own outside the classroom!"
1528221_cesta-newsletter-spring-2016.txt_9,DH Career Panel,"How do you launch and navigate a career in digital humanities? CESTA hosted a May rountdtabe to answer these questions, featuring seven Stanford faculty, staff, and students with firsthand knowledge on the subject.

Moderator Molly Taylor-Polesky opened the discussion by asking younger panelists, including graduate students fresh out of the job search process, for their thoughts and advice.

“"
1528221_cesta-newsletter-spring-2016.txt_10,The people hiring,"really want you to reflect on what the field is,” said Molly, who will be moving on to a new position at Middle Tennessee State University soon. “I think they’re really pressing you to tell them what they want, and they don’t quite know what they want.”

The second half of the panel focused on digital humanists more established in their professional lives, who talked career paths, the DH community, and time management. For example, some wisdom on research projects from Stace Maples, Geospatial Manager at the Stanford Geospatial Center: “Often you know exactly what you want to do, and 99 percent of what you do is getting ready to do what you want to do-- trying to get over the data hump.”"
1528221_cesta-newsletter-spring-2016.txt_11,Text Technologies,"Stanford TexT has continued to expand its activities in 2015-16, with a sequence of Text Technologies Fellows (Eric Weiskott, Zachary Hines, Stephen May, and Emma Cayley) visiting Stanford to work on their research and give seminars. In June 2016, the second Text Technologies Collegium on NetworkX will take place, co-hosted by visiting Stanford Humanities Center Fellow, Ruth Ahnert.

Text Technologies also completed its NEH-funded research, ""Global Currents,"" in collaboration with ETS in Montreal, McGill, and Groningen Universities. Funding from the Stanford Cyber Initiative, sponsored by the Hewlett Foundation, has led to the creation of a new research project, ""Cyber Text Technologies,"" in 2016-17. CyberTexT will test the extent to which all forms of human communication might be not only systematic, but also effectively skeumorphic, unconsciously emulative, and formulaically replicative. Since text technological transformation is constant and cyclical, the goal is to project into the future the ways in which trends will manifest themselves in the development of new information systems and forms of communication, from virtual reality to incorporeal technologies. Text Technologies welcomes all interested parties’ participation in any of its projects."
1528221_cesta-newsletter-spring-2016.txt_12,Amir Eshel on Using Lacuna in the Classroom,"Lacuna-- ""an open-source, online learning tool designed to create new possibilities for reading and learning collaboratively""-- was created in 2013 by the Poetic Media Lab. Since then, the project has truly taken off, and today the tool is used in classes at institutions from Stanford to Dartmouth to Foothill College. Darmouth is using the digital annotation platform to engage students in its first literature MOOC, American Renaissance X (https://sites.dartmouth.edu/edtech/2016/03/10/american-renaissance-x-and-lacuna-stories/) ; according to Dartmouth Ed Tech's article, Lacuna sees more activity than any other element of the course.

Amir Eshel, Edward Clark Crossett Professor of Humanistic Studies and Professor of Comparative Literature at Stanford, discussed how his experience using Lacuna in his courses.

How long have you been using Lacuna in the classroom now?

I think this year was the third. Different classes, different students, undergraduate and graduate students. We’ve been using it quite extensively.

What advantages have you seen from using Lacuna?

The level of engagement with reading materials is much higher. Students are much more aware of how they annotate, and how they share what they learn. And it gives me a much better sense of where individual students are: what they’re leaning, where they’re having difficulties, where I need to explain more. It also gives students who are less inclined to talk publicly a voice, which is a great thing.

What has it been like to integrate Lacuna into your courses?

It’s always a challenge, starting with the fact that not all classrooms have the right equipment to easily use it… It’s also a lot of information you get as a instructor. Going through those annotations is much more work. But I think those difficulties are not taking anything away from the viability and the beauty of the tool.

How have your students reacted to Lacuna?

I think that in particular young students, undergrads, love it and feel very comfortable with it. It’s the easiest thing in the world for them. The older students get, they have more difficulty with it. And I think that in a way our graduate students already belong to a different generation. Our graduate students kind of had to figure it out along the way. So I see a big divide.

Do you think technologies like Lacuna will be ubiquitous for even younger generations?

I think that in the future there will be much more technology in the classroom. I’m completely convinced about that. It doesn’t have to be necessarily Lacuna, but something like Lacuna, where you have access to materials wherever you are on your handheld device or laptop—it’s very convenient.

What have you learned from implementing the platform in the classroom?

Lacuna works very well with journal articles, with texts that I would say are up to around 40 pages. It works less well when you’re expected to read an entire book cover to cover. As you work with the system and get to know it, it does have limitations. So I think Lacuna is a tool one can add— and should add!— to the variety of tools we have, but it’s not the only tool we should be using. Like all forms of media, it is ultimately one more form of communication.

It’ been a wonderful experiment, and I’m very fortunate that the team came together.

What’s next for Lacuna?

Lacuna is great when it comes to analytical, critical engagement with texts. It’s less beneficial when your intention as an instructor is for students to generate creative work. So we’re working now with something called Poetic Thinking, a platform that’s supposed to foster the students’ ability to create: to create images and videos, to manipulate existing material. The platform is a way to disseminate, reflect on, and communicate with others and what they’ve created.

Brian’s research in Stanford's Modern Thought and Literature Program delves into “cultural memories of violence between the U.S. and the Middle East,” exploring in particular how the Crusades have been represented across media in the U.S. and Middle East after 9/11. Brian discussed his argument in his public lecture in Margaret Jacks, followed by a defense and, of course, a celebration."
1528221_cesta-newsletter-spring-2016.txt_15,Lit Lab Hosts Concept Lab Conference,"On April 4th and 5th, the Literary Lab hosted a special two-day event featuring members of the Cambridge and North American Concept Labs (https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fccdkconceptlab.wordpress.com%2F&h=3AQGWs18xAQGzLC9J_1wavV6GtWMnzYGa1WMFNUOU3rjxuQ&enc=AZOmYrdaMjsesfzcgdQfQgnCLJOLu10T9fWVJ6vxjauSyr-U2pBxxqKVBZQ0qfp9EAT7f45ta_TWZzSi8B8XbzeV5j8EO7gMYVkcC2LxuManUHaZr2) , which presented the current state of their multi-year trans-Atlantic project.

The Cambridge branch of the Concept Lab, founded by Peter DeBolla, is an interdisciplinary project aimed at establishing an entirely new field of enquiry: Distributional Concept Analysis, which is intended to complement and make contributions to the history of ideas, the philosophical and historical understanding of concepts, and digital humanities. It uses methodologies adapted and developed from computational enquiries into language and cognition to understand the “architecture” of conceptual forms.

The North American Lab, led by Cliff Siskin at New York University, takes the research trajectory of the Cambridge Concept Lab as its subject. Their work has been to simulate the move from ""concepts"" to the “conceptual architectures” that render them, by starting with the Cambridge Lab's results—abstract architectures—and then instantiating them in language."
1528221_cesta-newsletter-spring-2016.txt_16,Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Conference,"For four years, the Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project (http://web.stanford.edu/group/chineserailroad/cgi-bin/wordpress/) has sought to illuminate the lives of the 10,000-plus Chinese migrants who labored to build the Transcontinental Railroad in the 19th century. Stanford researchers worked with more than 150 scholars around the world to gather more comprehensive information on the workers’ experiences and legacy. As part of this effort, CESTA’s Spatial History Project created visualizations and maps to explore the migrants’ impact on “not just the physical but the social landscape of the West.”
In April, this massive project culminated in the 2016 Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Conference, hosted at Stanford, which brought together thirty scholars from North America and Asia to share research. Two packed days of presentations examined everything from historical cartoons to artistic depictions of the railroad workers to the separation of workers from their families; the conference finished up with two days of site visits to locations in the Sierras where Chinese laborers built."
1528221_cesta-newsletter-spring-2016.txt_17,Lit Lab Pamphlets,"The Literary Lab released their 12th pamphlet, ""Literature, Measured"" by Franco Moretti, which meditates on the work of the Literary Lab and its pamphlet series. In the Pamphlet 12's opening paragraphs, Franco reflects on the origins of the series:

""In 2010, none of the five authors of “Quantitative Formalism” had any idea they were writing a “pamphlet”. A well-known scholarly journal had been asking for an article on new critical approaches, and that’s where we sent the piece once it was finished. But it came back with so many requests for corrections, that it felt like a straightforward rejection."" But ultimately, Franco concludes, ""they did us a favor.""

Meanwhile, the New York Times (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/15/upshot/at-the-world-bank-a-shortage-of-concrete-language.html?_r=0) covered the Lit Lab's Pamphlet 9, ""Bankspeak: The Language of World Bank Reports, 1946 - 2012."" NYT featured Franco and Dominique Pestre's computer analysis of the bank's annual report over the years, which found ""a sharp decline in factual precision, replaced by... management discourse, a bureaucratic gobbledygook whose meaning is hard to decipher."""

ERNiE aims to chart the diffusion of cultural nationalism in the “long 19^th century,” including some of its afterlife tapering off in the 20^th century. This is traced in two dimensions: transnationally (across—and in some cases beyond—Europe) and intermedially (across different cultural fields, multimedia-style). The Study Platform of Interlocking Nationalism (SPIN) at European Studies at the University of Amsterdam has worked on the digital humanities project since 2008.

The Encyclopedia includes articles on important themes and people in the development of culturally inspired and culturally-expressed nationalism, from 1789 to 1914, and provides a portal to the SPIN collections of historical documentation-- roughly 4,000 visual, textual  and audio items. It also visualizes the connections between various themes and people.

ERNiE wishes to draw attention to culture not only as the intellectual and artistic ambitions which made nationalism, as an ideology, thinkable and attractive, but above all as the communicative medium which rendered a transnational diffusion of nationalism possible."

RECENT ARRIVALS

New at the Lit Lab: David McClure


David joined CESTA at the beginning of March as the lead developer at the Literary Lab, where he's working with Franco Moretti and Mark Aglee-Hewitt on projects that apply computational methods to research questions in literary history and theory. He's currently building a set of software tools to manage the lab's collection of corpora and working on a project that examines the history of the word ""literature"" in a corpus of ~5 million volumes from the Hathi Trust collection.

On the side, David is also the lead developer of the Open Syllabus Project, a data mining project based out of Columbia University that's extracting structured data from a corpus of over 1 million college course syllabi. He comes to CESTA by way of the Stanford library, and before that the Scholars' Lab at the University of Virginia, where he was the primary developer of Neatline, a digital map-making framework funded by the NEH and the Library of Congress.

Visiting Researcher: Jose Cree
Jose is a second-year PhD student from Sheffield University, UK. Her PhD is on ""The invention of addiction in early modern England."" At the moment she is using CQPWeb - a corpus version of EEBO-TCP - to find the ""objects"" and the ""subjects"" of addiction by examining word collocates--  that is, to find out what people were addicted to, and who those people were.

Jose's PhD is linked to ongoing work by the Sheffield-based Intoxicants Project (@intoxproject (https://twitter.com/intoxproject?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) ), which is creating an online database of intoxicant-related objects and events in early modern England.

Jose is excited to be here at CESTA for four weeks, working with Ruth and Sebastian Ahnert on their Tudor Networks of Power project. While here she has been disambiguating place names and assigning GPS co-ordinates to (hopefully all of) the 7,000+ locations in the letters, to allow the data to be mapped.

Postdoc: Trine Mygind Korsby

Dr. Trine Mygind Korsby started her two-year postdoc at CESTA and the Poetic Media Lab on March 1, 2016. She defended her Ph.D. in Social Anthropology at the University of Copenhagen in 2015; her work was based on long-term ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with pimps, sex workers and convicted human traffickers in Eastern Romania.

Trine's research deals with transnational crime, pimping, sex work, and the figure of the perpetrator. She works with anthropology of the body, skill, desire, love, morality, criminal livelihoods and notions of work and labor in a post-socialist context. In her postdoc project Trine focuses on the other kinds of crime that her informants carry out besides pimping, mainly credit-card fraud, scams and theft.

Trine spent part of her Ph.D. at UC Berkeley, where she became a part of a series of experimental collaborative seminars initiated by Professor in Anthropology Paul Rabinow. This has now developed into a Stanford-Berkeley working group, which focuses on developing the digital teaching platform Lacuna into a platform for collaborative concept-work and data sharing for researchers. Together with other members of the working group Trine uses the collaborative research version of Lacuna to analyze and conceptualize her empirical data, contributing to the development of this version of the platform.

Lena Marie Heppler
Congratulations to long time CESTian Jason Heppler and his wife Margo on the arrival of their new little one in February! Here we can see little Lena already making big plans for big data...

DEPARTING

Frederico Freitas

Frederico is finishing a Ph.D. in Latin American History with Zephyr Frank as his advisor. He has been involved with DH initiatives at Stanford since he began at Stanford's graduate program in history in 2010: he first worked as a research assistant at the Spatial History Project before CESTA was even created. Prior to coming to Stanford, he worked for ten years as an art director doing mostly graphic design and motion graphics, and used that expertise in projects for CESTA and the Spatial History Project. For example, he worked in the summer of 2011 in two Terrain of History projects, where he managed the work of undergraduate RAs and both helped to conceptualize and designed these two (http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/viz.php?id=375&)  visualizations (http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/viz.php?id=377&) .

Frederico's dissertation research, on the establishment of national parks at the Brazil-Argentina border, was recently featured in Stanford News (https://news.stanford.edu/2016/01/26/parks-brazil-argentina-012616/) ; it also resulted in a visualization that is published at the Spatial History site (http://cesta.stanford.edu/projects/boundaries/) . Frederico is currently working on a new project with Zephyr Frank, Erik Steiner, and Daryle Williams from the University of Maryland: a peer-reviewed publication on the spatial history of nineteenth century Rio de Janeiro. He will continue to work on this project (remotely) after he graduates from Stanford in June.

In August Frederico will start as an Assistant Professor of History at North Carolina State University, as part of their new DH initiative called “Visual Narratives.”

Matt Bryant

Matt was hired as the central administrator for CESTA when it came into being in March of 2012. His position and responsibilities have morphed and changed a lot over the years, as CESTA has grown in leaps and bounds. Many of his various responsibilities have now been solidified into the new CESTA Center Manager position, which will be taken on by Celena Allen.  The official recognition and creation of this new position is a significant milestone in CESTA's growth and longevity.

Matt will relocate to Greensboro, North Carolina in July, with his lovely wife Julia and their fuzzy children. You'll likely find him out in the wood shop or engaged in various fixer-upper projects around their new home.

Molly Taylor-Poleskey


Molly is a graduate student of history at Stanford. In August, she will be moving to Tennessee to become the professor of digital history at Middle Tennessee State University, where she plans to recreate some of the lab-mentality of CESTA to enhance the University's DH offerings.

At CESTA, Molly has worked with Jason Heppler to create D3 visualizations of her dissertation research on 17th-century food consumption in Prussia. She is also about to finish a historical mapping project entitled ""Journey Down the Rhine,"" which charts the 1613 wedding journey of Princess Elizabeth Stuart and Elector Friedrich V of the Palatinate, right before the outbreak of the Thirty Years War.

And of course like to congratulate Molly on the very recent arrival of her son, Richard Jones Poleskey! Molly is thus celebrating both departure and arrival at the same time....

Nick Bauch


This autumn, the Spatial History Project's Geographer-in-Residence, Nicholas Bauch, heads to the University of Oklahoma for a new job.  He will assume the twin roles of Assistant Professor of GeoHumanities and Director of the Experimental Geography Studio, both in the Department of Geography and Environmental Sustainability.

Congratulations to Nick and everyone on their new adventures. From everyone here at CESTA - may you have a safe and wonderful summer, wherever you are!

1815413_cesta-newsletter-summer-2016.txt_1,A Message from the Director,"Welcome to the first CESTA Newsletter of the new academic year! It’s a pleasure to welcome everyone back to what will be an exciting session, with an unprecedented number of seminars, conferences, and visiting scholars in CESTA throughout 2016-17. Highlights include a new bi-weekly CESTA Seminar series to be held on Tuesday lunchtimes in which new and agenda-setting research in the Digital Humanities will be presented; the DH Asia series of Visiting Fellowships, directed by Tom Mullaney, will bring eminent scholars to CESTA to discuss their scholarship; Spatial History hosts postdoctoral researcher Frederik Noren from Umea; Brian Johnsrud will be directing the enhanced Graduate Fellowship program; and our major curricular initiatives—the DH Minor and the Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities—will bring very welcome increased student participation in the work that we do in CESTA.

CESTA was buzzing throughout the summer, with dozens of researchers engaged here on our many scholarly projects. Student Research Assistants spent the weeks of summer quarter in the friendly environment of our space on the fourth floor of Wallenberg, and they delivered excellent presentations on their scholarship in a two-day colloquium in late August. Many visiting scholars brought their innovative work to CESTA, which proves to be a consistently inspirational and collaborative place to be. During these months, and with our thanks and congratulations, Sarah Ogilvie and Nicole Coleman left CESTA for new positions within the institution, and Matt Bryant left to take up residence in North Carolina. We are delighted to have Celena Allen as the CESTA Center Manager and Gabe Wolfenstein as Research and Scholarship Manager, and with our newly reorganized office and dedicated staff and students, this will be a vibrant and busy year for us. We very much welcome your participation in
any of our programs, events, and research activities. We offer tremendous expertise and support to faculty and student researchers, and look forward to seeing you in the coming months."
1815413_cesta-newsletter-summer-2016.txt_2,About that logo ...,"You may have noticed that the header image for our newsletter is a little different this time around! CESTA is proud to announce the launch of its new logo, reflecting our evolution, expansion, and continuing investment in scholarly innovation.

Designed by Sylvia Li, the new logo, which replaces the black-and-white “C” that had represented CESTA since its founding in 2012, maintains continuity with the previous logo while updating it for CESTA’s evolving institutional identity. Through smoothly curving but asymmetrical ellipses, the image reflects the wholeness of CESTA’s community while embracing the diverse and experimental scholarly paradigms that are sheltered under the Center’s roof. The four colors included in the logo echo our Stanford affiliation while also setting CESTA apart as a nationally and internationally recognizable institution. And our choice to focus on the Center’s acronym not only recalls our name’s origins in the Portuguese word for “basket” — an association that reflects the abundance and inclusiveness of our research community — but also indicates that CESTA is more than the sum of its parts.

As we update our online presence, letterhead, and promotional materials to reflect the new logo, we appreciate your patience and support. If you use the CESTA logo in any of your materials — from websites to posters to publications — please join us in updating them, and feel free to contact us (mailto:cesta_stanford@stanford.edu) with any questions or concerns.

Thank you! We hope you love our new look as much as we do."
1815413_cesta-newsletter-summer-2016.txt_3,Introducing CESTA's New Website,"CESTA is pleased to announce the launch of its new website, which went live on September 20, 2016. We hope that this new site will be an accessible entry point for scholars, students, and members of the general public seeking to learn more about the exciting world of digital humanities at Stanford.

The new site is still located at cesta.stanford.edu (https://cesta.stanford.edu/) , but has a host of new features designed to make it easier for visitors to learn about CESTA people, projects, and opportunities for education and funding. From the home page, you’ll have easy access to the CESTA Mission Statement (https://cesta.stanford.edu/about/about-us) ; lists of CESTA staff and affiliates (https://cesta.stanford.edu/people) ; information on programs and opportunities (https://cesta.stanford.edu/cesta-research-programs) for Stanford faculty, graduate students, undergraduates, and external collaborators; CESTA news and events (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/recent-news) ; and a collection of resources (https://cesta.stanford.edu/resources) on digital humanities for everyone from beginners to established scholars. We’re especially excited about our new hub for projects and labs (https://cesta.stanford.edu/projects-labs) , which allows visitors to browse the full array of

1815413_cesta-newsletter-summer-2016.txt_4,Literary Lab Launches Techne Blog,"Building on the success of their longstanding pamphlet series, the Stanford Literary Lab has branched out into a more informal way of sharing work in progress: Techne (https://litlab.stanford.edu/techne/)  (litlab.stanford.edu/techne (https://litlab.stanford.edu/techne/) ), a blog that elaborates on the Lab's digital methodology and affords opportunities for spontaneous research and collaboration.

In his introduction to the blog, Lab Director Mark Algee-Hewitt expressed his intention to ""make visible the invisible work of the Literary Lab"" by ""present"
1815413_cesta-newsletter-summer-2016.txt_5,ing,"different stages of investigation and alternate modes of research."" These goals were in evidence in the blog's first three posts, which range from Lead Developer David McClure's narrative of the challenges involved in analyzing 1.2 terabytes of textual data on a massive computing grid to a critique of non-humanistic literary research by Project Manager Hannah Walser. Algee-Hewitt also contributed one of the initial posts, pulling back the curtain on the neural network that the Lab has used to identify suspenseful passages in novels.

In the coming months, look forward to blog posts on digital pedagogy, ""small DH,"" and the relationship between digital humanities and the natural sciences, as well as technical overviews of the Lab's automatic poetry parser and its new corpus management system. For regular updates on Techne, follow the Literary Lab (https://twitter.com/literarylab) on Twitter!

1815413_cesta-newsletter-summer-2016.txt_6,Text Technologies News,"Text Technologies was delighted to welcome international participants in its second annual Collegium in June, this time on NetworkX, co-hosted by Dr. Ruth Ahnert, Visiting Fellow at the Stanford Humanities Center. The subject proved a topic of lively debate, with multiple perspectives on network theory and practice in research areas as diverse as Early Modern drama, Anglo-Saxon place-names, and twentieth-century fiction.


As presenters gave their talks, the conference organizers took notes on whiteboards to ""network"" the event itself, registering the interconnected themes and methods that emerged from the discussion. The final image (above) offers a sense of the richness of the conversation and leaves us all the more excited for next year's Collegium! Scheduled for May 2017, the theme of the Collegium will be ‘Text, Textiles, and Texture’, co-hosted with Professor Kathryn Starkey.
Two Text Technologies Fellows, Dr Claude Willan and Dr Rebecca Munson, joined us in August for a wonderful week of collegial research.

Claude Willan was able to focus on a number of his projects, including his outstanding research into eighteenth-century manuscripts associated with Alexander Pope (https://digitalhumanities.princeton.edu/2016/01/27/pope-manuscripts-online/) , and A History of Text Technologies (co-authored by Elaine Treharne and to be published by Stanford University Press). Rebecca Munson, whose scholarship focuses on the transmission and reception of Early Modern drama, gave an excellent presentation on her new findings about networks of readers and their textual interventions in surviving copies of plays.

Meanwhile, thanks to a grant from the Cyber Initiative, funded by the Hewlett Foundation, CyberText Technologies began its work in earnest in June. The project seeks ultimately to predict future text technologies, based on the narratives of the past. Research assistants Jessica Beckman, Grace Klein, and Clare Tandy began the process of gathering data on cuneiform, papyrus scrolls, and early codices, with a view to determining the system of text technological transformation that might characterize every major form of human communication.
Research assistants created 3D printed replicas of early text technologies.
Their research paid off within months, and we have seen previously unknown patterns emerge, which are fundamental to understanding how textual technologies evolve over time. The project moves to its second phase in the autumn quarter, assessing how we can measure, map and navigate identified major trends within technological cycles.

1815413_cesta-newsletter-summer-2016.txt_7,Poetic Media Project News,"The Poetic Media Lab's Lacuna annotation system has launched its first Knowledge Base (http://www.lacunastories.com/knowledge-base/) for instructors: a pedagogical resource compiling model assignments, lesson plans, in-class activities, and other teaching tools using Lacuna's digital annotation platform. Developed in collaboration with the Stanford Graduate School of Education and refined through classroom testing both at Stanford and in collaborating community colleges such as Foothill College, Lacuna's Knowledge Base helps instructors manage student annotations in the interest of more effective lectures and classroom discussions. Specific assignments guide students through tagging texts for literary keywords, organizing their papers using textual evidence, and synthesizing information in collaboration with classmates.

In addition to this new pedagogical implementation, the Lacuna team is continuing its project of collecting data on how students read in its first Reader Study, launched this July. Open to any researchers interested in reading practices and the pedagogical use of literary texts, this new platform (http://www.readerstudy.com/) allows investigators to upload texts, create cohorts of participants, and create questions to probe readers' interpretation and retention of a text. Lacuna's digital annotation system means that the data participants generate while reading at home can be aggregated, qualitatively coded, and analyzed by literary scholars and instructors. To learn more about the project or to try out the Reader Study software, contact the primary investigator, Brian Johnsrud, at johnsrud@stanford.edu. (mailto:johnsrud@stanford.edu)

Last but certainly not least, this summer Lacuna made its first (but surely not last) appearance in a dissertation in the Graduate School of Education. Emily Schneider defended her Ph.D. dissertation, Designing Digital Tools for Digital Reading, this September in the GSE's program in Learning, Technology, and Design. Congratulations to Dr. Schneider!

1815413_cesta-newsletter-summer-2016.txt_8,CESTA in Leeds,"The International Medieval Congress is no ordinary conference. When over 1,800 medievalists gather in one city, there are of course panels, poster sessions, and keynote speeches — but you might also find a medieval ball, a historical food festival, or a dancing unicorn. Part academic event, part summer camp for medievalists, it's a quirky but intellectually rigorous scene — and at this summer's IMC, held from July 4-7 at the University of Leeds, CESTA was present in full force.

On a panel organized by Director Elaine Treharne and sponsored by Text Technologies, CESTA researchers presented their results from the multi-institutional, NEH-funded Global Currents (https://globalcurrents.stanford.edu/) project. Stanford's portion of the project involves modeling the visual and textual features of medieval manuscripts: using machine learning, the team was able to encode and classify some 100,000 examples of mise-en-page, or page layout, in English manuscripts from the twelfth century. In collaboration with partners at L'École de technologie supérieure in Montreal and the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, CESTA's team, which included Celena Allen, Mark Algee-Hewitt, Benjamin Albritton (Stanford University Libraries), Liz Fischer (undergraduate RA), and Matthew Aiello (who earned his BA at Stanford and recently completed an MA at Oxford), were able to train algorithms to recognize and capture characters, titles, notable letters, enlarged letters,
and blank space on the pages of these medieval texts.

The panel discussed both the nitty-gritty of manuscript feature analysis and the larger implications of the Global Currents collaboration. Celena and Liz led off with an overview of the project, while Matt described the surprising insights that can be gleaned from undergraduate research assistants who are new to the study of medieval manuscripts. Ben explained the team's use of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) to make their findings accessible to a wide range of users. And Elaine closed the panel with a case study that revealed how big data can enable discoveries that would otherwise be impossible in the context of medieval manuscripts.

To learn more about Global Currents, visit the group's website (https://globalcurrents.stanford.edu/) !"
1815413_cesta-newsletter-summer-2016.txt_9,CESTA at DH 2016,"For five hectic days, digital humanists from around the world gathered in the heart of Krakow's Old Town for DH 2016, this year's Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations conference. Current and former CESTA affiliates were well represented in the conference's densely packed schedule, which included conventional papers, poster sessions, and a diverse assortment of workshops.

Members of the Stanford Literary Lab showcased the role of DH in investigating diversity and identity: J.D. Porter and Vanessa Seals mapped the distinctive kinship structures of plays by white American and African-American authors, while Grace Muzny and Mark Algee-Hewitt demonstrated the usefulness of dialogue in computationally detecting the performance of gender. Meanwhile, Glen Worthey, well-known to CESTA and CIDR researchers as Stanford's Digital Humanities Librarian, led a ""Translation Hack-a-thon,"" experimenting with solutions to the problem of DH's largely monolingual community.
Current CESTAns also used the conference to catch up on the latest work of some past colleagues: former CESTA Graduate Research Fellow Claude Willan, currently a postdoctoral research associate at the Princeton Center for Digital Humanities, presented on ""Faceting and Mining Network Graphs,"" while Marissa Gemma, formerly of the Literary Lab and currently at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics, led a workshop on digital literary stylistics and presented ongoing research with Stanford collaborator Ryan Heuser.

Between conference events at Jagiellonian University, attendees explored the vibrant and picturesque city, learning about Polish history at Wawel Castle and the Wieliczka Salt Mines or enjoying pierogis and piwo in Krakow's Grand Square. A warm dziękuję to our hosts! We look forward to reuniting in Montreal for DH 2017."
1815413_cesta-newsletter-summer-2016.txt_10,Mapping Rome ... Not in a Day,"After more than ten years of field work, digital analysis, and digging in the archives, a group of historians, classicists, architects, and archaeologists converged at CESTA this August to discuss the results of a collaborative research project on the architectural and urban development of Rome. In addition to the Spatial History Project's own Erik Steiner, the event featured James Tice (Architecture, University of Oregon); Nicola Camarlengi (Art History, Dartmouth); Georg Schelbert (Art History, Humboldt University Berlin); Allan Ceen (remotely present from the National Gallery); and Giovanni Svevo, a Roman archaeologist. Stanford's Giovanna Ceserani (Classics), Nick Jenkins (English), and Stace Maples (Geospatial Center) were present as respondents, while Cathy Aster of Digital Library Systems Services explained the process of building a Spotlight exhibit for the project.

Though a project with such a long history has necessarily undergone many metamorphoses, the team's consistent endeavor has been to create a layered history of Rome: a map that reflects the historical changes, both in architecture and in mapmaking itself, that can redefine the contours of a single space. Working from the great masterpieces of Roman cartography and topography, including the detailed 18th-century Gianbattista Nolli map, Giuseppe Vasi's views of Roman streets and monuments, and Rodolfo Lanciani's magisterial 1901 Forma Urbis Romae, the project has constructed an interactive website (http://mappingrome.com/)  where everyone from scholars to curious students and members of the general public can explore historical Rome. In addition to a palimpsestic interface that allows viewers to visualize different map layers selectively — to toggle between, for instance, contemporary satellite images and pathways on Gianbattista Noli's 1748 map of the city — the project's web
presence includes interactive tours of prominent Roman piazzas and detailed scholarly essays by the participants.

Screenshot from one of the project's web viewers, Imago Urbis: Giuseppi Vasi's Grand Tour of Rome
Though much of the presentation focused on the magnificent data, digitizations, and visualizations already produced by the Mapping Rome crew, the discussion period also delved into some complex theoretical and methodological questions, touching on issues of curation, pedagogy, and the scholarly commons. As the Rome project moves into the future, it will continue to evolve with the field of digital humanities, contemplating when it is appropriate to shift from amassing data to analyzing it, whether data platforms can encourage creative thinking, and how scholars can preserve their computational findings for future generations. Meanwhile, a multi-layered map of medieval Rome is already underway ... We can't wait to see where the Rome project goes next!
------------------------------------------------------------"
1815413_cesta-newsletter-summer-2016.txt_11,Summer RA Activities,"How long does a thought take? How can we digitize a dance? How do technologies of communication evolve? These were just a few of the questions raised by CESTA's Research Assistants as they shared their work at the annual end-of-summer symposium.

Many RAs, like those working on the Chinese Railroad Workers of North America Project, used their collaboration with faculty as a starting point for their own independent research. The students had plenty on their plate, as Michael Carter described: in addition to annotating documents about Chinese laborers, the team was tasked with tracking down nineteenth-century Post-Central Pacific Railroad maps and georeferencing them with Google Earth data. Many students, however, pursued individual interests on top of this research: Ian Miller, for instance, hunted for documents about the aforementioned Ah Ling, while Griffin Bovee reconstructed the personal and familial histories of Chinese railroad workers in California's Central Valley. Driven by her interest in education and pedagogy, Juliana Chang developed an annotated bibliography of children's books about Chinese railroad workers for K-12 teachers. And, in a project to which she has devoted two years of her undergraduate
education, Niuniu Teo analyzed payroll records from railroad companies, tracking Chinese employees' salaries, work schedules, and other details in an attempt to reconstruct the daily lives of these too-often forgotten historical actors.

Friends of CESTA settle in for a day packed with ""visualizations and stuff.""
RAs from the Literary Lab and the new CyberText Technologies initiative showcased the productive dialogue between principal investigators and student researchers on so many DH projects. In addition to steering their own research agendas — an investigation of ""postmodernism"" vs. ""post-postmodernism"" by Sarah Thomas, or social networks in early modern drama as tracked by Lise Wolentz — Lit Lab RAs contributed invaluably to some of the Lab's long-term ""flagship"" projects: Asha Isaacs, for instance, worked to populate a database of all the texts included in the Norton Anthology series and tagged characters in novels to help examine the discourse of race in American fiction. On another new project that asks formidably big questions, CyberText Technologies RAs Clare Tandy and Grace Klein delved into a massive data set and emerged with discoveries, hypotheses, and an interactive timeline of media forms. Although their initial research posited an evolution from cuneiform through
papyri to scrolls and manuscripts, Clare and Grace quickly realized that the history of text technologies was far more diverse, including everything from aboriginal Australian message sticks to tactile Micronesian maps.

Not all of the projects were forbiddingly technical. While Ena Alvarado and Irene Hsu brushed up on their Drupal skills to polish the Lacuna annotation platform, Naomi Subotnick used her artistic skills to create beautiful pen-and-ink illustrations for an online edition of a nineteenth-century Brazilian melodrama. Naomi is also involved in the digitization of Anna Halprin's dance scores, an endeavor that requires both technical prowess and a powerful visual imagination. Similarly, Samuel Mignot found himself enmeshed in questions of performance, orality, and the poetics of place while working on a website exploring the life of nineteenth-century slave poet George Moses Horton. And Yesid Castro played around with different visualization methods to represent ""Geographies of Capital"" in the most intellectually and aesthetically pleasing form.
Research Assistants with the Literary Lab presenting on"
1815413_cesta-newsletter-summer-2016.txt_12,project,"Some projects featured at the showcase were brand new and others were nearing completion, but several were reaching a climactic stage that left spectators wanting more. After Alex Sherman gave a preview of the Writing Rights project's elegant new visualization tool, which allows users to view their own annotations and tags as nested tree rings, many audience members voiced their desire to be part of the application's beta testing group. Michael Carter's presentation on Kindred London likewise prompted a flurry of curiosity on the process of reconciling maps of London spanning over three centuries, shedding light on the difference between our desire to stabilize a kind of abstract Cartesian city and mapmakers' immediate goal of facilitating navigation through a complex, disorderly space. To current and historical maps, the Imagined San Francisco project, as explained by Kevin Garcia, added the even more tantalizing domain of counterfactual maps, cataloging the history of
unrealized urban planning schemes in an attempt to illuminate the flow of political, economic, and cultural power in the city.

Congratulations to all of CESTA's RAs on a successful summer of research! We hope to see many of you again in the coming academic year.
------------------------------------------------------------"
1815413_cesta-newsletter-summer-2016.txt_13,Follow the Money Website Launch,"CESTA announces the release of a new Spatial History Lab website titled Follow the Money (http://followthemoney.stanford.edu/) . The project uses digital mapping technology to illustrate the geography of ten federal programs that have shared revenues with counties in the eleven states of the Far West. These payments derive from natural resource activities on federal lands, and they have been an intrinsic feature of federal conservation since the early 20th century. The project, which is an ongoing effort to gather data, is led by historian Joseph Taylor (Simon Fraser University), and the team at Stanford includes Celena Allen, Krista Fryauf, Alex Sherman, and Erik Steiner.

The website was custom built to help the public and researchers understand the history of county payments across time and space. The data is adjusted for inflation based on 2014 dollars, and five-color coding schemes help reveal the patchy geography of each payment program. At a glance users can recognize counties with high, middling, or low payments, and they can make comparisons both among counties in a given year and, using the advanced function, within counties across years.

Users can also click on individual counties to gain a deeper sense of the arc of payments over time, and how those payments compare with all other western counties. Each map includes a short history and brief analysis of that particular program. Viewers wishing to learn more can access longer essays on each program, complete with an accompanying bibliography.

The effect of these maps is to graphically illustrate the political economy of the federal domain. Federal lands constitute roughly 47 percent of all lands in the western states, none of which can be taxed by the states or counties. By tracing these payments across the 20th and early 21st centuries, the maps reveal how commodity markets and environmental regulation has been entangled with the history of taxation and social services across the West, and how shifts in production have affected the ability of counties to provide social services.
------------------------------------------------------------"
1815413_cesta-newsletter-summer-2016.txt_14,New Publication: Reading Rio de Janeiro,"Just in time for the 2016 Summer Olympics, Zephyr Frank's new book, Reading Rio de Janeiro: Literature and Society in the Nineteenth Century (Stanford University Press), hit the shelves this year. Zephyr, director of the Spatial History Project and former director of CESTA, combines close readings of novels with quantitative data analysis in this exploration of the unique social, economic, literary, and spatial world of nineteenth-century Rio.

Drawing upon evidence ranging from experimental novels to parish records and city maps, Zephyr's latest work showcases the role of CESTA's interdisciplinary, collaborative atmosphere in generating knowledge. In an interview (http://news.stanford.edu/2016/08/02/stanford-historian-explores-roots-rio/) with Stanford News, Zephyr emphasizes the role of both the Spatial History Project and the Literary Lab in shaping his argument, allowing him to construct ""a digital picture of nineteenth-century Rio"" that provided a foundation for mapping the movements of fictional characters. The picture painted by the book — one of accelerating capitalist development that has effects not only on legal and economic but also on artistic and social systems — reflects the joint influence of geospatial humanities and quantitative textual analysis on Zephyr's research.

Zephyr will spend the 2016-17 academic year as a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, where he will devote his attention to a second volume that shifts its attention from novels to theater and popular television. Whether the object of his close reading is a nineteenth-century play or a contemporary telenovela, Zephyr brings to his work a sociological framework that approaches popular narratives as ""transcripts for social history.""

Congratulations to Zephyr on his latest publication!

1815413_cesta-newsletter-summer-2016.txt_15,Jasper Ridge Renderings Win Atlas of Design Recognition,"The Spatial History Project's research and Erik Steiner's fabulous 3D renderings of the historical ecology at Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve have been selected for inclusion in the Atlas of Design, a biannual international juried competition featuring ""the best maps in the world."" Through interactive visualizations like those below, Erik, Maria Santos, and Jon Christensen have registered long-term environmental and ecological changes in the San Francisquito Creek watershed, which includes Jasper Ridge, Stanford, Palo Alto, East Palo Alto, and Menlo Park.

The Atlas will be released in October at NACIS (the North American Cartographic Information Society). A draft of the maps has been hanging outside the large conference room for a few months now; we'll pick up a few printed Atlases next month to have around the lab for inspiration."
1815413_cesta-newsletter-summer-2016.txt_16,RA Spotlight: Ena Alvarado,"My name is Ena Alvarado, and I am a rising junior from Caracas, Venezuela. This past summer, I worked as a research assistant for the Poetic Media Lab, the Literary Lab, and the Medieval Source Book project. I learned to use Drupal, a content management system; I read short stories and novels, tagging them for their time progression; and I examined text annotations from Lacuna Stories readers. As a prospective English major, oddly enough, I enjoy reading and writing immensely. I also love watching foreign films, daydreaming in café shops, and amateurishly playing the guitar.
------------------------------------------------------------"
1815413_cesta-newsletter-summer-2016.txt_17,Visiting Scholars,"Once again, CESTA hosted scholars from around the world this summer, providing a home base for research that draws upon a wide variety of digital methods to approach humanistic questions.

The Spatial History Project was thrilled to host collaborators on site for several weeks this summer, including visits from Ethan Blue (Senior Lecturer in History, University of Australia), who continued his research on deportation trains in the early twentieth-century U.S.; Lea Vandevelde (Josephine R. Witte Professor of Law, University of Iowa), principal investigator of the Law of the Antebellum Frontier project; and Ocean Howell (Assistant Professor of History, University of Oregon), whose Imagined San Francisco project explores the history of abandoned urban planning schemes in SF. The Mapping Rome forum (see above) also hosted Jim Tice, Nick Camerlenghi, and Giovanni Svevo, among others. Thanks for coming!


Starting in September, CESTA is lucky enough to host Frederik Norén of Umeå University in Sweden. Frederik's work focuses on how the Swedish government stores, codes, and uses information about its citizens: how does a nation with a strong history of institutional record-keeping adapt to the information age? While at Stanford, he will use topic modeling to investigate the language of new media and communication in government documents. If you see Frederik, stop by and say hello!

1815413_cesta-newsletter-summer-2016.txt_18,Arrivals and Departures,"The wheel of fortune rolls on, the sands of time trickle through the hourglass, and CESTA staff members come and go ...

Departures

We were very sad to say goodbye to two beloved researchers, colleagues, and friends this summer — but relieved to know that both will still be working at Stanford! Nicole Coleman has moved to the Stanford University Libraries, while Sarah Ogilvie is housed in the Linguistics department. We wish them both the best in their new positions, and hope that they'll come back for frequent visits!

Arrivals

Hannah Walser comes to CESTA from the English Department at Stanford, where she earned her PhD this June. Co-appointed in CESTA and the Literary Lab, Hannah will serve as Project Manager in the Lab while handling communications and publicity at CESTA. She adores her new officemates and is excited to deepen her involvement with the world of DH!

1993697_cesta-newsletter-fall-winter-2016-2017.txt_1,A Message from the Director,"This has been a busy and exciting year in CESTA, with the inauguration of our new fortnightly seminar series, and a record number of new colleagues, projects and researchers participating in the work of the center. We have innovative grant applications underway, and inspiring collaborations in the pipeline with scholars from all over the world, including institutions in Europe, South Africa, and Australia.
We have been delighted to host a well-attended new seminar series on alternate Tuesday lunchtimes. During the autumn, we were treated to groundbreaking presentations from Mark Algee-Hewitt (Literary Lab), Tom Mullaney (DH Asia), and Nicholas Jenkins and Erik Steiner (Kindred London). Winter had a packed schedule of presentations, including colleagues such as Alice Staveley of the Modernist Archives Publishing Project, Giovanna Ceserani of the Grand Tour Project, Brian Johnsrud of Lacuna, and Shelley Fisher Fishkin of the Chinese Railroad Workers in North America project.

Our programs have got off to an excellent start, with a splendid cohort of undergraduate researchers contributing to major projects in the Literary Lab, Spatial History, and the Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project, among others. The preparation of brand new translations of early literary texts continued apace in Professor Kathryn Starkey’s Global Medieval Sourcebook and researchers for Cyber Text Technologies amassed information and case studies for tablet, scroll and book technologies from c.4000 BCE to 1400 CE. The Humanities + Design team, directed by Dan Edelstein and Nicole Coleman, continued its development of Fibra with the help of a generous ACLS grant and presented the results at a CESTA Seminar. Brian Johnsrud is directing this year's Graduate Fellows cohort, and other curricular efforts—from the Digital Humanities Graduate Certificate, to undergraduate courses in DH—are thriving. We are looking forward to a wonderfully productive close to the academic
year! We hope to see you this spring quarter."

1993697_cesta-newsletter-fall-winter-2016-2017.txt_3,DH Fellows,"In the 2016-17 academic year, CESTA is thrilled to welcome seven new Graduate Digital Humanities Fellows. Chosen through a competitive application process that emphasizes independent thinking and innovative methods, the fellows meet weekly to discuss recent developments in digital humanities, develop skills through workshops, present work in progress, or simply build community by working in a shared space. The program culminates in a research showcase where fellows share the fruits of their labor.
No two members of this year's cohort are based in the same department, a development showing both the broad popularity of the Graduate DH Fellows program and the diversity of digital humanities practices at Stanford. Their interests range from the Soviet literature of World War II (Daniel Bush) to religiosity in Chinese Buddhist monks (Sangyop Lee), from manuscript networks in Anglo-Saxon England (Jonathan Quick) to performance repertoires in the British colonies (Kellen Hoxworth); the results may take the form of social networks of romance novelists (Chris Larsen), maps reflecting the local place-making practices of Portobelo, Panama (Marguerite De Loney), or genealogical databases of colonial families of eighteenth-century Brazil (Leo Barletta). To learn more about this magnificent suite of projects, mark your calendars for May 31 from 1:00-5:00 p.m., when the fellows will present their research at the annual symposium!"
1993697_cesta-newsletter-fall-winter-2016-2017.txt_4,RA Spotlight: Stephanie Niu,"Hi! I’m Stephanie, a sophomore majoring in Symbolic Systems. Since last autumn, I’ve been working with the Chinese Railroad Workers’ Project to design and build data visualizations that convey the experience of the Chinese transcontinental railroad workers. Telling a data-driven story using historical data is a challenge, but it’s also an exciting opportunity to use data visualization techniques to convey a historical and under-documented experience that would be otherwise difficult to imagine. I’m grateful for the opportunity to work at CESTA and am constantly learning from the project and the people in it. Outside of classes and CESTA, I spend my time dancing/choreographing, making soap, and napping relentlessly."

1993697_cesta-newsletter-fall-winter-2016-2017.txt_6,Literary Lab News,"La Littérature au Laboratoire: that was the title of the Literary Lab's pamphlet collection as it appeared this October from French publisher Ithaque. The anthology, edited and with an introduction by Stanford professor and former Lab director Franco Moretti, includes many of the Lab's greatest hits, from ""Quantitative Formalism,"" their first ever pamphlet, to 2016's ""Canon/Archive."" While the French edition happened to make it past the finish line first, the anthology will appear in a number of languages, including Spanish, Italian, German, and of course (in 2017, from n+1) English.

Although the anthology encompasses the first 12 pamphlets published by the Lab, the series is far from over: Pamphlet 13, on ""The Emotions of London,"" was also released this October. The fruit of a collaboration between Moretti, Ryan Heuser, and the Spatial History Project's Erik Steiner, the project uses a combination of digital mapping and sentiment analysis to reconstruct the affective space of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century London, discerning the ""narrative geography"" of such authors as Dickens, Trollope, Thackeray, and more.

In 2017, the Lab has yet more in store, including a collectively authored essay on ""The Novel as Data"" that will appear in the new Cambridge Companion to the Novel (May 2017) and an article on ""Representations of Race and Ethnicity in American Fiction"" forthcoming in Cultural Analytics. In addition to publications, Lab Director Mark Algee-Hewitt has presented the Lab's research in a number of settings this academic year, from Princeton to Tallahassee to Glasgow to Banff.

Back at Stanford, Franco Moretti returned for two lectures on the triumphs and challenges of digital humanities this winter. In the first talk, ""Patterns and Interpretation,"" Moretti reflected on the Literary Lab's work to date and made a strong case for the continued — or, indeed, greater than ever — relevance of theory and explanation in the age of ""big data."" The second talk was co-presented by Moretti and Leonardo Impett, a doctoral student in digital humanities at the École Polytechnique Féderale de Lausanne in Switzerland. The duo shared preliminary results from an exciting new project applying quantitative methods to the visual arts, analyzing patterns of emotional expression in the paintings collected by art historian Aby Warburg in his Atlas of Images. Moretti was also present for the second annual Lab Day, when members of the Literary Lab gather for flash presentations on new project ideas; this year, twelve lab members — ranging from undergraduate RA Lis Wolenetz
to graduate students from multiple departments to the Lab's directors — shared work on topics as diverse as Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, the language of Cold War foreign policy, suspense in 19th-century dime novels, and the sociology of Goodreads.

Stay tuned in spring quarter for more exciting events, including an interdisciplinary conference on ""Findings"" in the digital humanities."
1993697_cesta-newsletter-fall-winter-2016-2017.txt_7,Poetic Media Lab News,"Earlier this fall, the Poetic Media Lab was proud to welcome its second cohort of community college fellows in the EPIC (Education Partnership to Internationalize Curriculum) program. Funded by a Title VI grant from the U.S. Department of Education, the program allows fellows to work with partners at Stanford on projects using the Lacuna digital annotation platform developed by the Poetic Media Lab, exploring opportunities for digital technologies to enrich classroom discussion and foster diverse learning communities. The fellows, who hold faculty positions at Foothill, De Anza, and San Mateo community colleges, will present their projects to the broader community at a symposium this spring. For more information on the EPIC program or to view presentations by last year's fellows, visit the Poetic Media Lab's website (https://poeticmedia.stanford.edu/lacuna-launches-second-cohort-epic-community-college-fellows) .

From the local to the global: this winter, the Lacuna platform was also adopted at several major Scandinavian universities, including the University of Uppsala (Sweden), the University of Copenhagen (Denmark), and the Norwegian University of Technology and Science (Norway). In March, the Poetic Media Lab welcomed faculty and academic technology staff from the Norwegian University of Technology and Science for a 2-day workshop introducing them to the technology, curriculum, pedagogical practices, and teaching opportunities using Lacuna in higher education classrooms. CESTA is thrilled to see Lacuna expanding its reach and learning as it grows.

Lacuna is a digital annotation and learning platform developed by the Poetic Media Lab.
It's no surprise that the Poetic Media Lab's newest tool is already developing a similarly international profile! Historians from the University of Patterborn in Germany have launched their study of how university students and professional historians read historical texts, particularly texts about the Crusades. Using Reader Study (www.readerstudy.com (http://www.readerstudy.com/) ), an open-source platform built by the Poetic Media Lab to track reception of texts, the Patterborn researchers will analyze the survey and annotation data tracked by the platform to see how individuals interpret different historical texts about the Crusades, and how they understand them in relation to the present era. The first study using Reader Study, conducted by Brian Johnsrud, examined the reception of Jonathan Safran Foer's post-9/11 novel Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close and was presented by Brian Johnsrud at a CESTA Seminar on February 14 (see above for more details).

Last but not least, Trine Korsby, a postdoctoral researcher in the Poetic Media Lab, returned from a month of ethnographic fieldwork in Romania in December to learn that she and a team of anthropologists, criminologists, and political scientists have received a 2 million euro European Research Council grant to research international organized crime. Trine's fieldwork looks at the moral economic of transnational pimping, exploring how morality is experienced and performed by the pimps themselves — the people often categorized as immoral perpetrators. Her ethnographic work is analyzed and processed using digital tools like Lacuna, the digital annotation platform built by the Poetic Media Lab. Congratulations to Trine on this stunning success!

Trine Korsby, whose research on transnational pimping and the figure of the perpetrator has been funded by a European Research Council grant."
1993697_cesta-newsletter-fall-winter-2016-2017.txt_8,Chinese Railroad Workers in North America News,"In addition to presenting the Chinese Railroad Workers in North America project to a packed house in one of this winter's CESTA Seminars, Prof. Shelley Fisher Fishkin also traveled to Yale this February to share the project with the Center for the Study of Race, Indigeneity, and Transnational Migration. Fittingly, the talk was co-sponsored by Yale Public Humanities and the Digital Humanities Lab at Sterling Memorial Library: the capacity of the CRRW project to connect scholars and the public — not only sharing the results of academic research, but enriching it through the stories of everyday individuals — was very much in evidence at the CESTA Seminar, where many of the attendants counted at least one Chinese railroad worker among their ancestors. Such collaboration and cooperation is essential to a project that aims, not only to answer historical questions about the migration of Chinese laborers to the U.S. in the nineteenth century, but to reconstruct a lifeworld.

Meanwhile, back on the Farm, the CRRW visualization team — especially RAs Stephanie Linlin Niu and Yue Li — has been developing numerous topographical maps showing key points along the Central Pacific railroad. Thanks to Beijing-based photographer Li Ju, another form of visualization is now linked to the project: an exhibit of railroad photographs taken along the Central Pacific route and displayed at Stanford this fall. Li Jiu traveled the route of the Central Pacific Railroad four times, revisiting and re-photographing sites documented by nineteenth-century photographer Alfred Hart. The exhibit has now traveled to Menlo College, where it will remain on display at the Bowman Library from March 23 through May 5, 2017.

The CRRW project is also excited to welcome Kevin Hsu on board. Kevin is a Lecturer in Urban Studies at Stanford University, where he co-founded the Human Cities Initiative, and an urban scientist with Disney Research. His work focuses on bringing human-centered design and sustainable energy infrastructure to the study of cities, with a particularly interest in how sustainability maps onto efforts to protect tangible and intangible heritage and promote cultural continuity. Kevin will be working on, among other things, the CRRW project's future digital publications."
1993697_cesta-newsletter-fall-winter-2016-2017.txt_9,Spatial History Project News,"This winter quarter saw the launch of the Spatial History Project Working Group, a new monthly meeting that fosters community within the SHP while giving researchers an opportunity to share and receive feedback on their work in progress. The meetings, which take place on the last Thursday of each month, started off in February with a presentation from Luca Scholz (Andrew W. Mellon Fellow in the Humanities and Lecturer in the Department of History) on mapping pre-modern territoriality using digital tools; in the March meeting, George da Guia (Ph.D. Candidate, University of Brasilia, and Visiting Scholar in the Department of History at Stanford) shared his research mapping the flows of capital in Latin America and the Caribbean over the last fifty years. Don't miss the spring quarter meetings, scheduled for April 27 and May 25!

After last summer's successful ""Mapping Rome ... Not in a Day"" symposium, where scholars from CESTA and around the globe discussed a collaborative effort to bring the great masterpieces of Roman cartography to life in digital form, the Spatial History Project is delighted to announce the launch of the online Lanciani Archive (https://exhibits.stanford.edu/lanciani) . Building on Rodolfo Lanciani's magisterial Forma Urbis Romanae (1901), the archive includes prints, photographs, street maps, floor plans, and other images related to the key sites mapped by Lanciani, organized into exhibits that mimic the folder structure used by Lanciani himself. The site also includes curated multimedia essays on everything from architectural features to Roman archaeology to the economic history of the city. Hosted through the Stanford University Libraries, the site is an invaluable resource for students of both ancient and 20th-century Rome, scholars browsing primary materials, and members of
the general public hoping to explore

The Spatial History Project is also excited to welcome a new graduate research assistant into the fold. Leo Barleta, a doctoral candidate in Stanford's Department of History, joined the SHP this fall and has already spearheaded the creation of the SHP Working Group — all while participating in CESTA's Graduate DH Fellows program as well. Leo's own research focuses on the formation of domestic markets on the periphery of the Portuguese Empire during the 17th and 18th centuries, and he has previously worked at CESTA as a research assistant under the direction of Zephyr Frank. In his new role, Leo organizes events, facilitates communication, and supports project development for the SHP; you've probably already seen his emails in your inbox!"
1993697_cesta-newsletter-fall-winter-2016-2017.txt_10,Text Technologies Project News,"Written in ink, parchment, paper, wood, and stone, the materials and transmission of text has captured scholarly attention around the globe. This spring, CESTA faculty and graduate students joined scholars at Fudan University, Shanghai, for the second International Conference on Medieval-Early Modern Text Technologies (March 29-31). This year’s theme, “From Manuscript to Print: Medieval Europe and China,” invited participants to explore and connect these dual traditions.

Scholars from CESTA and Fudan University in Shanghai
CESTA director Professor Elaine Treharne joined Professor Chen Yinchi (Fudan) in welcoming scholars to this transhistorical conversation. Participants investigated topics ranging from Chinese epitaphs to Christian liber vitae, letter writing, scribal and calligraphic cultures, and the global appearance of print. Advanced graduate students and CESTA fellows Jonathan Quick and Jessica Beckman gave papers on their current research, while Likun Yang and Yafang Bao provided tour-de-force translation of conference discussions in English and Chinese.

The conference was the second organized by the East-West Text Technologies Research Project, a multi-year investigation into the global history of text technologies. Conceived by Professors Ron Egan and Elaine Treharne, these events generate an innovative and multi-disciplinary body of work about the history of human communication.

The conference was generously supported by Department of Chinese at Fudan University, as well as Stanford’s Confucius Institute, Dean of Research, Departments of English and East Asian Languages and Cultures, and Stanford Text Technologies."
1993697_cesta-newsletter-fall-winter-2016-2017.txt_11,DH Asia Receives Sawyer Seminar Funding,"CESTA congratulates Prof. Tom Mullaney, whose highly successful DHAsia initiative was recently awarded a Sawyer Seminar grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Sawyer Seminars are intended to bring together faculty, graduate students, and visitors from a variety of disciplines to discuss large-scale, comparative humanistic questions. Described by the Mellon Foundation as ""temporary research centers,"" the seminars typically allow for the funding of one postdoctoral researcher and two graduate students, as well as for regular meetings that incorporate presentations and guests from multiple institutions.

In the case of DHAsia, these capacities will not only contribute to the sustenance of that program's workshop series, but will also allow for a more intensive study of non-Western digital humanities, with special focus on East, South, Southwest, and Inner-Central Asia. Drawing upon both the expertise of researchers studying Asian texts by digital means and the technological resources of Silicon Valley, the Seminar will culminate in a white paper assessing the needs and future of Asian digital humanities. CESTA looks forward to another year of exciting conversations and groundbreaking research!

1993697_cesta-newsletter-fall-winter-2016-2017.txt_12,New Project Spotlight: Greece and Rome in South Africa,"The Spatial History Project has always been a home for innovation in both scholarship and public humanities, and this year's crop of new projects continues the tradition. Of particular note is the ""Greece and Rome in South Africa"" digital museum helmed by Professor Grant Parker of Stanford's Classics Department. In South African history, classical Greece and Rome have been evoked both in expressions of colonial power and in resistance to the apartheid state, serving as a polyvalent source of imagery, rhetorical tropes, and cultural authority. Using multimedia sources from public art to political cartoons, historical maps to theatrical performances, Prof. Parker's museum aims to answer the question: what is at stake in the presence of Greece and Rome in a postcolonial context such as South Africa? Research Assistant Tamu Adumer is currently helping Prof. Parker explore Stanford Spotlight exhibits and other potential tools for displaying materials reflecting this provocative
historical intersection."
1993697_cesta-newsletter-fall-winter-2016-2017.txt_13,New Project Spotlight: Mapping Ottoman Greece,"One of CESTA's most exciting new projects in the 2016-17 academic year comes from Professor Ali Yaycioglu (https://history.stanford.edu/people/ali-yaycioglu) , a member of Stanford's Department of History with a longstanding interest in mapping, spatiality, and digital geospatial analysis. In Mapping Ottoman Greece: Space, Power and Empire, Prof. Yaycioglu will collaborate with Professor Antonis Hadjikyriacou of Bogazici University in Istanbul to map the political and economic landscape of Greece during the Ottoman period, extending from roughly the early 18th to the mid 19th century. Working with CESTA's Erik Steiner and Research Assistants Kevin Garcia and Connor Kennedy, the researchers will layer in a diverse assortment of data — ranging from topographical data gathered from field research to archival texts in Greek, Ottoman-Turkish, French, Russian, and English — to build a geospatial database that accurately reflects the many networks of power and influence that
structured Ottoman Greece: administrative, military, ethnic, scholarly, mercantile, and more. Keep an eye on Mapping Ottoman Greece for what are sure to be fascinating and beautiful digital visualizations of a vanished empire.

1993697_cesta-newsletter-fall-winter-2016-2017.txt_15,CESTA Seminars: A Successful Start,"Chinese typesetters, African artworks, French philosophes, British travelers ... This year's new CESTA Seminar series has introduced us to an eclectic and exciting variety of subjects, methodologies, and contexts. Always scheduled over lunch on a Tuesday, these talks allow Stanford faculty from a variety of disciplines to present their latest digital humanities research, bringing together a diverse group of attendees to discuss the cutting edge of the field.

A packed house for the final CESTA Seminar of fall quarter.

The academic year began with a presentation from Tom Mullaney (https://history.stanford.edu/people/tom-mullaney) (Associate Professor of Chinese History, Stanford; Director, DH Asia (http://dhasia.org/) ) on his ongoing research project, Hot Metal Empire: Script, Media, and Colonialism in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Prof. Mullaney introduced us to a global network of trade and culture produced by the advent of ""hot metal"" printing technology — an innovation that vastly accelerated the pace of typesetting and, thereby, made it possible and profitable to produce books for a broader variety of international audiences. Through a fascinating tour of the material foundations of twentieth-century printing, Prof. Mullaney explained the ""deskiling"" of type design in the hot metal regime and explored the complex colonial and anti-colonial print cultures that emerged from the mass production of non-Latin typescripts.

In his talk on character networks in more than 3500 English plays, Mark Algee-Hewitt (https://english.stanford.edu/people/mark-algee-hewitt) (Assistant Professor of English, Stanford; Director, Literary Lab (https://litlab.stanford.edu/) ) took us from media history to text mining, drawing connections between the evolving role of the protagonist and shifting social structures from 1550-1900. Prof. Algee-Hewitt's research proposed two variables to explain much of what's interesting about dramatic morphology: ""protagonism"" and ""mediatedness."" Protagonism asks: just how central is a play's central character — that is, how densely connected is this protagonist in the play's social network? Mediatedness, on the other hand, reflects how cliquish a play's social network is: are there many characters that travel between different social worlds, or only a few? Both metrics, Prof. Algee-Hewitt found, become more evenly distributed over the course of the 17th and 18th centuries:
dramatic morphology shifts from a single major character (a king or prince) surrounded by subordinates to tight-knit groups of relative equals.

Innovative visualizations were also on display in the final talk of autumn quarter, where Nick Jenkins (https://english.stanford.edu/people/nicholas-jenkins) (Associate Professor of English, Stanford) and Erik Steiner (Co-Director, Spatial History Project) shared the groundwork for a novel approach to mapping London neighborhoods. The presentation, titled ""Soft City: A Biomorphic Map of London,"" was grounded in Steiner's observation that neighborhoods, unlike many other geographic entities, are relational by definition — and thus provide an ideal opportunity for unconventional mapping approaches. To capture this inherent fuzziness, the researchers represented London neighborhoods as overlapping ovals that help users visualize the uncertainty generated by subjectivity. The resulting maps are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also generate exciting new fields of inquiry: constructs like ""overlaps,"" for instance, allow us to ask what's going on in regions of intense overlap,
and what it feels like to exist in and move through those regions.

Winter quarter was even busier: six CESTA Seminars showcased projects at various stages of development, from the longstanding archive of the Chinese Railroad Workers of North America project to the first experiment with Lacuna's new Reader Study platform. Giovanna Ceserani (Associate Professor of Classics, Stanford) kicked things off with an introduction to the Grand Tour Project, a digitized, searchable database drawing from John Ingamells's classic Dictionary of British and Irish Travelers in Italy, 1701-1800. For Ceserani, the Grand Tour not only names a phenomenon involving the circulation of people, texts, artistic styles, and artisanal techniques between Italy and Northern Europe; it also represents a unique historiographical challenge, since the records of this widespread yet decentralized phenomenon are dispersed across many locations and throughout different media. Ceserani's solution to visualizing this dense fabric of interactions involves a tool with two modes,
""search"" and ""explore,"" allowing scholars and interested laypersons to interact with the data in forms ranging from detailed metadata to animated maps.

A similarly rich, complex, and problematic historical archive was on display in the Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project, presented by Shelley Fisher Fishkin (Professor of English, Stanford; Director, American Studies Program), Hilton Obenzinger (Lecturer, American Studies and English, Stanford), and Gabriel Wolfenstein (Research and Scholarship Manager, CESTA). Over the past five years, the CRRW team has produced an impressive array of publications and conferences in both the U.S. and China, but the project's true power still comes from its ability to illuminate the lives of these too easily forgotten figures, whether through payroll records, archaeological finds, or the stories of the railroad workers' descendants. The resulting database testifies to the exploitative labor practices of railroad magnates even as it demonstrates the remarkable resilience and skill of these workers, who formed new communities thousands of miles from their hometowns. Prof. Fishkin
closed the presentation with a wise and timely reminder to remember the Chinese Exclusion Act, and its painful consequences, as we reflect on who we are as a nation.

If the CRRW project gathers together an archive spanning several decades, multiple continents, and thousands of individuals, the Modernist Archives Publishing Project (MAPP) aims to account for the activities of a single publishing house as thoroughly as possible, constructing a deep and comprehensive history of the Hogarth Press. Alice Staveley (Lecturer in English, Stanford), Helen Southworth (Associate Professor of English, University of Oregon), and Michael Widner (Stanford University Libraries) walked us through their evolving site while exploring a longstanding tension in digital humanities: restoring the status of books as unique objects through visual technologies vs. ""unlocking"" the content of books from its physical specificity via textual technologies. The two are eminently compatible, the team argued, but their intensely specific, absorbing rendition of each unique edition published by the Hogarth Press, both in its material form and its intertextual context, made
a compelling case for the former approach.

Brian Johnsrud introduces the Reader Study platform.
Book as object, book as text ... but books are also experiences, as Brian Johnsrud's presentation on ""Using Digital Methods to Find 'The Reader'"" reminded us: despite our best efforts to generalize, the phenomenology of reading remains stubbornly unique from one reader to the next. In his talk, Johnsrud (Co-Director, Poetic Media Lab) used a study on reader responses to Jonathan Safran Foer's Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close to introduce Lacuna's exciting new Reader Study tool, which allows scholars to explore readers' annotations through both qualitative coding and demographic sorting methods. The highlights and marginalia tracked in the Reader Study platform, Johnsrud showed, let us construct a ""heat map"" of the reading experience, tracking a reader's every chuckle, gasp, or yawn over the course of a novel. When organized in a well-controlled study, the results not only offer a fascinating window into the subjective world of readers, but also help us to draw more
responsible conclusions about the role of emotion and interpretation in literature.

Of course, digital humanities is about far more than just texts, as Susan Gagliardi (Assistant Professor of Art History, Emory University) reminded us in her presentation on ""Mapping Senufo."" The label ""Senufo,"" originally imposed by European colonists on the West African peoples of Mali and Cote d'Ivoire, has been used to label a geographical area, a language group, an ethnicity, and a visual style that draws particularly high prices on the art market. Yet these various constructions, Prof. Gagliardi noted, don't overlap much in reality: Senufo art is not necessarily localized to the Senufo region or even produced by the Senufo people. In the face of such confusion and ambiguity, Prof. Gagliardi asked — echoing a question that arose in many of the quarter's CESTA Seminars — what would an effective and accurate visualization look like? The Mapping Senufo site constitutes an answer-in-progress, experimenting with different ways of organizing the diverse and often contradictory
metadata attached to particular artworks — and allowing users to pose new questions about the relation of identity to style.

It was fitting to close the quarter with a presentation from two researchers who have been with CESTA from its earliest days: Nicole Coleman (Digital Research Architect, Stanford University Libraries) and Dan Edelstein (Professor of French, Stanford). The pair presented their latest tool, Fibra — funded in part through a grant from the American Council of Learned Societies — as an aid in the process of ""thinking through data"": the slow, reflective interpretation of evidence that humanities research, in particular, depends upon. Fibra hopes to harness the promise of linked data for the humanities: in its ideal iteration, a researcher would be able to hand-draw a network and then, in real time, pull in data about the nodes from sources like the Library of Congress or the Bibliothèque Nationale Française. The team was the first to acknowledge the many challenges on the way to that goal, including the difficulty of mapping one data framework onto another — itself, as Coleman
pointed out, a form of valuable (and undervalued) scholarship. But after watching a presentation that elegantly reconciled the sometimes conflicting demands of humanistic interpretation and quantitative rigor, it was hard not to be optimistic."
1993697_cesta-newsletter-fall-winter-2016-2017.txt_16,Information in Policy and Politics,"When Fredrik Norén visited CESTA from the Department of Culture and Media Studies at Umeå University in Sweden, he had a mission: figure out how the late 20th-century concept of ""information"" changed government policy and discourse in Sweden. In some nations, such a project would be huge and intractable — but in Sweden, the object of study was clear: a collection of approximately 8000 governmental reports published since 1922 on subjects ranging from abortion and labor policy to electronic music and ""the place of the artist in society."" This unique corpus, both well-structured and successfully digitized, represented, in Norén's words, ""the voice of the Swedish state"" — and offered an ideal starting point for the research that he presented at CESTA on November 7, toward the end of his two-month stay at Stanford.

A recent entry in the Swedish government report series. The title may be roughly translated as ""The people, the media and the market"".
Through conversations and collaborations with CESTA researchers and staff like David McClure and Gabe Wolfenstein, Norén was able to approach his corpus through topic modeling, and when an ""information"" topic emerged from the algorithm, he tracked its correlation with other concepts and discourses. As a keyword, Norén found that ""information"" exploded in the 1970s, right around the time the Swedish welfare state was solidified. Drawing upon the theoretical work of John D. Peters while providing a wealth of empirical data, Norén argued in his presentation that ""information"" became a kind of silver bullet for the state, rendering the populace increasingly transparent and trackable even as social problems were increasingly framed as problems of communication.

Fredrik ended by articulating a goal for future research that all digital humanities practitioners would do well to keep in mind: ""to improve the transparency of research by structuring the interaction between close and distant reading."" In future collaborations with Umeå and beyond, we CESTAns will do our best to achieve that end."
1993697_cesta-newsletter-fall-winter-2016-2017.txt_17,Tremulator: A Digital Tool for Processing Medieval Manuscripts,"During week 10 of winter quarter, one of the most hectic times of the academic year, the father-son team of David and Ian Johnson nonetheless drew a packed house of Text Technologies aficionados to their presentation on a new tool for collecting and visualizing medieval manuscript data, Tremulator. Drawing equally upon David Johnson's expertise in Old and Middle English as a Professor of English at Florida State University and Ian Johnson's experience as a UX Engineer at Google, the Tremulator was developed in the context of David's research on the Tremulous Hand of Worcester, a thirteenth-century scribe known for his distinctively shaky, left-leaning handwriting. The Tremulous Hand left behind some 50,000 glosses, and the distinctive problem of making sense of such a large and diverse array of manuscript fragments informed the design of Tremulator. In particular, Tremulator aims to smooth the transition from collecting and sorting to visualizing and interpreting data from
medieval manuscripts, making ""irregular"" data more tractable and offering a new addition to the toolkit of digital paleography.

Although Tremulator emerged from the demands of a specific research agenda, David and Ian Johnson made a persuasive case for its applicability to a broad array of periods, genres, and literary traditions. The presentation sparked animated discussion not only in the room but also on Twitter, and left attendees excited about the potential for more precise analysis of the many layers of annotation, glosses, and marginalia found in medieval texts."
1993697_cesta-newsletter-fall-winter-2016-2017.txt_18,CESTA in the News,"Several of CESTA's researchers and projects have attracted media attention recently — a sign, perhaps, of how effective digital methods can be as a tool of humanities outreach. First there was a Stanford News article to mark the launch of the Follow the Money (http://followthemoney.stanford.edu/) website, a collaboration between Joseph Taylor (Professor of History, Simon Fraser University) and the Spatial History Project's Erik Steiner that uses digital mapping technology to illustrate the geography of federal programs that have shared revenue with counties in the American West. The article (http://news.stanford.edu/2016/11/30/new-interactive-stanford-website-presents-unexamined-data-federal-programs-aid-local-governments-american-west/) not only emphasized the project's relevance to contemporary debates about the role of the federal government in public lands, but also shone a spotlight on the undergraduate research experience that CESTA can provide: former RA Krista
Fryauff, who now works as a software engineer, claims that her time at CESTA helped her develop the skills that she uses in her current job.

Another mapping project, this time with a literary bent, was featured in Atlas Obscura, an online magazine that ""covers the world's hidden wonders."" In a detailed article (http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/london-literature-mapping-emotions) , Atlas Obscura explored the Literary Lab's Emotions of London project, finding particular interest in the contrast between London's real-life nineteenth-century expansion and its relative condensation in literary texts. The article also emphasized the potential of digital methods to find the large-scale, repeatable correlates of the subjective experience of emotion, drawing attention to the association of happiness with wealthy neighborhoods and sadness with impoverished ones that emerges on the scale of 5,000 texts.

Finally, a National Geographic segment on the maps cartographers made as children (http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/02/maps-cartographers-made-as-kids/) featured an adorable hand-drawn map of Wales from our very own Erik Steiner (circa age 10). Yes, young Erik was under the impression that Wales was an island -- but the map's meticulous attention to detail and (very) thorough legend speak of a great cartographic career to come!"

1993697_cesta-newsletter-fall-winter-2016-2017.txt_20,Introducing Luca Scholz,"You may have noticed a new face around CESTA this year: Luca Scholz (https://history.stanford.edu/people/luca-scholz) , one of Stanford's newest Andrew W. Mellon Fellows in the Humanities. Luca comes to Stanford from the European University Institute in Florence, where he earned his Ph.D. in History; he has also taught at the Frei Universität Berlin and conducted research as a visiting scholar at the University of Saint Andrews and at Columbia University.

Luca Scholz, Mellon Fellow in the Humanities and Lecturer in the Department of History
While teaching in the Department of History, Luca is also conducting research at CESTA on regimes of movement in the early modern period. Expanding upon his doctoral thesis, which drew upon more than twenty archives to examine the role that inter-polity mobility played in the construction of the early modern state, Luca's current research approaches the history of free movement (and its restriction) through digital mapping techniques. ""Beyond Borders,"" as the project is titled, reveals that the boundaries between states are much more than abstractions on maps; rather, they are actively constructed through security checkpoints, landscape features, infrastructure, and other material interventions.

We are thrilled to have Luca with us and look forward to watching his research develop over the next two years. If you see him around the office, be sure to say hello!"
1993697_cesta-newsletter-fall-winter-2016-2017.txt_21,Visiting Scholars,"As always, CESTA was proud to host a number of visiting researchers during fall and winter quarters, providing a home base for scholars from other institutions to conduct their digital humanities research at Stanford. In addition to Fredrik Norén, mentioned above, CESTA has welcomed Greg Walker, Thomas Nygren, Alexanre Gefen, Marianne Reboul, and George da Guia over the past few months.

Greg Walker is Regius Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature at the University of Edinburgh; his CESTA connection comes by way of Director Elaine Treharne, with whom he co-edits the Oxford Textual Perspectives monograph series. Prof. Walker's research focuses on the literary culture of the Tudor period, with a particular interest in theatrical culture and stagecraft; his current project is a biography of the Tudor playwright John Heywood, who, in addition to his own literary and musical talents, was a nephew by marriage of Thomas More and grandfather to the poet John Donne. It was a pleasure to have Prof. Walker conduct his research at CESTA!

Thomas Nygren, an associate professor of history and education and senior lecturer in the Department of Education at Uppsala University in Sweden, is a familiar face to many CESTAns: during the 2014-15 academic year, he was a postdoctoral fellow in digital humanities at Stanford under the auspices of the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation. His research has focused on diverse aspects of the teaching of history, from the ""Media Places"" project on the use of data and visualizations in pedagogy to his comparative research on how human rights are communicated in the classroom. Prof. Nygren's visit to CESTA in October was brief and informal, but it represented a welcome reunion with a longtime collaborator and friend!

Alexandre Gefen and Marianne Reboul came to CESTA this February from the Sorbonne's Labex-OBVIL (Observatoire de la vie littéraire), where they have been collaborating with Literary Lab members on a Mellon-funded study of the historical evolution of ""literature"" (the word and the concept) for the past two years. Prof. Gefen is head of the Center for French Language and Literature Studies at the Université Paris-IV; he is also the founder of the literary website Fabula (https://www.fabula.org/) , a major venue for Francophone literary criticism, and has published scores of books and articles. Marianne Reboul is a doctoral candidate at the Université Paris-IV, where she is at work on a thesis comparing translations of Homer's Odyssey from the 16th-20th centuries using digital means. She is currently developing software that will allow researchers to easily analyze differences among translations in multiple languages. During their visit, Alexandre and Marianne were hard at work
on the CESTA floor almost every day, but they did take time off to enjoy the California sunshine and visit the SF MoMA. Their collaborators, colleagues, and (dare we say?) friends at the Literary Lab were thrilled to host them and enjoyed the opportunity to chat with them in formal and informal contexts, always over a seemingly endless supply of pastries.

George da Guia is a Ph.D. candidate in the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism at the University of Brasilia, from which he also holds an MA in regional and urban planning. From January-March 2017, he has been a Visiting Scholar in Stanford's Department of History and a fixture on the CESTA floor, where the ever-fluctuating stacks of books on his desk indicate his diverse interests: data visualization, the history of urban spaces, Brazilian geography, and more. During his time at CESTA, George's research has focused on the complexities of the cultural heritage ""industry,"" mapping not only capital but also discursive formations as they flow between global financial institutions and national or local heritage sites in Latin America and the Caribbean. In addition to conducting his own research, George has been a wonderful presence at CESTA's events this winter quarter, posing incisive questions at the biweekly seminars, supporting his colleagues' research, and becoming a true
member of the CESTA community."
1993697_cesta-newsletter-fall-winter-2016-2017.txt_22,Arrivals and Departures,"Like waves ebbing and flowing upon a shore, so are the movements of CESTA staff members through academia ...

Departures

This autumn, CESTA affiliate Jason Heppler headed to the University of Nebraska at Omaha for a new job! There he has assumed the roles of Digital Engagement Librarian and Assistant Professor of History. While at CESTA, Jason supported various digital projects as an Academic Technology Specialist in the History Department. Congrats Jason, we miss you!

Looking sharp, Jason!

Arrivals

The Literary Lab is delighted to welcome Allison Hegel, who is working at the Lab as an intern and collaborator during the 2016-17 academic year. Allison is a PhD candidate in the Department of English at UCLA. Her dissertation, Social Reading in the Digital Age, uses digital humanities methods to investigate contemporary literature and how we talk about that literature online. Her most recent project uses natural language processing and machine learning methods on a corpus of over 100,000 online book reviews to determine the criteria by which readers categorize books into genres.

901201_cesta-monthly-newsletter-february-2015.txt_1,PLAYING WELL WITH OTHERS,"Welcome to the latest edition of the CESTA newsletter! It has been a very active and busy year already, with lots going on around the Center. We do try to make some time for socializing, having fun, and embarking on activities such as the Marshmallow Challenge (http://marshmallowchallenge.com/Welcome.html) , organized by our Spatial History Project creative director Erik Steiner. In this competition, teams of three were tasked with the challenge of building a structure out of 25 spaghetti sticks, a yard of masking tape, and a yard of string, to see who could support and elevate a single marshmallow at the highest elevation - all in an extremely short amount of time. The winning team in this competition was comprised of director Zephyr Frank, Center guest Cheryl Gilge from the University of Washington, and Center manager Matt Bryant. However, controversy soon ensued, in which the winning structure only lasted seconds before toppling. Therefore, the real winners were actually
Humanities + Design postdoc Giogrio Caviglia, history grad student Fred Freitas, and crowdsourcing project manager Gabe Wolfenstein. This was a lot of fun, and we highly recommend that you try this with your group.

901201_cesta-monthly-newsletter-february-2015.txt_2,NEW PROJECTS,"CESTA has taken on a number of new projects and partnerships in recent weeks, and we look forward to supporting these efforts and watching them flourish. Some of these projects are already ongoing, and we've simply come together to collaborate through shared resources, others are brand new projects just taking shape. We are exited to be working with so many interesting people and ideas. Our latest official collaborations include:

Text Technologies
Global Currents: Cultures of Literary Networks, 1050-1900
Elaine Treharne, Roberta Bowman Denning Professor and Professor of English
Mark Algee-Hewitt, Assistant Professor of English

This project undertakes the cross-cultural study of literary networks in a global context, ranging from post-classical Islamic philosophy to the European Enlightenment. Integrating new image-processing techniques with social network analysis, we examine how different cultural epochs are characterized by unique networks of intellectual exchange based on the visual data of texts. Research on “world literature” has become a central area of inquiry today within the humanities, and yet it poses two major challenges for large-scale computational analysis. Our combined approach of visual language processing and network modeling allows us to address these challenges in two distinct ways: 1) to study the non-western and pre- and early-print textual heritages so far resistant to data analysis; and 2) develop a new model of global comparative literature that places diverse literary cultures in conversation with one another while preserving a sense of the world’s cultural differences.

Martin Luther King, Jr. Project
Jonathan Greenberg, Scholar in Residence at the Daniel Martin Gould Center for Conflict Resolution at Stanford Law School
Jonathan Greenberg is Scholar in Residence at the Daniel Martin Gould Center for Conflict Resolution at Stanford Law School, and Director of its Martin Luther King, Jr. Project. This project explores Dr. King’s intellectual genealogy, the strategic dynamics of key municipal and national direct action campaigns under his leadership, and the meaning and evolution of his legacy, with attention to geographical, textual and visual design concerns aligned with CESTA’s research focus and methods.  Jonathan’s interdisciplinary scholarship is published in a wide range of academic volumes and journals.  He teaches as a Lecturer at Stanford Law School and at Stanford University’s Program in Public Policy.



Memorial Mapping: Transnational 9/11 Memorials and Geographies of Global Anti-Terrorism

Erika Doss, Professor, Marta Sutton Weeks Fellow, Stanford Humanities Center

In the years since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, hundreds of 9/11 memorials have been built in the United States and around the world.  The global circulation of 9/11 memorials is unusual, as permanent commemorations of the tragedies of particular nations are typically confined to those nations.  This project aims to “map” 9/11 memorials built in countries other than the United States, providing a geographic database of their locations, styles, subjects, dedication histories, and audiences.  The development of this memorial corpus will allow for the assessment of the cultural and political determinants motivating such memorials, including issues of global anti-terrorism.


Spiritual Networks 1890-1930
Jane Shaw, Professor, Department of Religious Studies


In Britain, America and parts of Europe, the late nineteenth and early twentieth century witnessed the advent of the phenomenon we know today as ‘spiritual but not religious.’ Many different sorts of people turned to their own experience and to ‘spirituality’ as they understood it in a general sense, rejecting or standing on the margins of institutional religion. Some seekers held multiple spiritual/religious affiliations. All of this made for interesting and unexpected connections as people sought the like-minded across literary, artistic, religious and spiritual communities. This project will initially take about 250 individuals (primarily spiritual/religious leaders, writers, intellectuals and artists), the majority of them in Britain, but some in North America, Europe, and parts of the British Empire, and will map out the connections between them. The result should throw up some surprising nodes or clusters of activity, as well as some startling connections, which will be
mapped visually in a digital humanities project; this proposed spatial history project would complement the monograph I am writing on this subject.



George Moses Horton, the 19th Century Hip Hop Poet
Cecil Brown, Ph.D, Lecturer UC Berkeley


George Moses Horton (1797? - 1883?) started his life as a slave in the fields. Despite this situation, he was also very entrepreneurial, and began to sell fruit on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, about 8 miles from his master’s home. While there, he demonstrated a great facility with poetry, composing poems for the undergraduate students on the spot. These ranged from acrostics to impress a student’s sweetheart, to more personal poems. Charging 25-75 cents for these, Horton was able to earn more money than the professors of the time. Though his master would not let him buy his freedom, Horton was able to buy his time, spending most days on the campus during the year.Through the connections he made there, he became the first African American poet to be published in the 19th century, and an important figure for abolitionists.
As an important and understudied historical figure, Horton presents the potential to do something unique in the digital humanities: recapture the importance of aurality and orality. This project envisions creating a digital platform, offering users the ability to interact with Horton, both in terms of research, as well as recreating how undergraduate students at Chapel Hill would have interacted with Horton over a century and a half ago. The goal is to make it possible for people to better understand oral culture, and would also create a database for researchers to explore the orality of poetry, as well as to better understand the importance of Horton himself.


Spaces of Mexican Migration
Ana Minian, Assistant Professor of History and if Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity


Her current book project explores the late-twentieth-century history of Mexican undocumented migration to the United States, the growth of migrant communities, and bi-national efforts to regulate the border. It uses over two hundred oral history interviews, government archives, migrant correspondence, privately held organizational records and personal collections, pamphlets and unpublished ephemera, and newspapers and magazines collected in Washington D.C., Chicago, the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Michoacán, Zacatecas, and Mexico City. As the first sustained history of transnational Mexican migration from 1965 to 1986, this work addresses audiences interested in U.S. and Latin American political history, Latina/o history, and Migration Studies. Minian is also working on a project on the United Farm Workers (UFW) union and another on Guatemalan transmigration through Mexico and into the United States."
901201_cesta-monthly-newsletter-february-2015.txt_3,HE'S A NATURAL,"CESTA Post-Doctoral Scholar Nicholas Bauch (http://www.nicholasbauch.com) represented the Spatial History Project last October at the first ever California Naturalist Conference in Pacific Grove, CA.  The conference created a forum for presenting and discussing new research and developments in natural history, stewardship, citizen science, global change, environmental education, and interpretation for addressing California's environmental challenges.

Videos of the entire conference have just been released (http://calnat.ucanr.edu/2014Conference/Presentations/) , including Bauch’s presentation “Artistic-Geographical Practice (http://lecture.ucanr.org/Mediasite/Play/6ca1f0c35592458396b7e78b42a7edf41d) .”

It’s also worth your time to check out the highly inspired talk delivered by John Muir Laws (http://www.johnmuirlaws.com/ ) , called “Exploring nature, art, and stewardship (http://lecture.ucanr.org/Mediasite/Play/4e5c0fdfdd0f4842a27efd54660a4eb11d) .”  Laws connects knowing nature with drawing, and ultimately, with cultivating peace."
901201_cesta-monthly-newsletter-february-2015.txt_4,VISITORS,"CESTA has recently had a few visitors from afar, and here's a little bit about what they were up to on their visit.

KATE SWEETAPPLE and JACQUELINE LORBER KASUNIC
Professors Kate Sweetapple and Jacqueline Lorber Kasunic from the University of Technology at Sydney visited CESTA for eight days in February to spend some face-time with collaborators in Humanities + Design.

Sweetapple and Kasunic are working with Keith Baker (History) and Dan Edelstein (French) on a project called Writing Rights, which looks at the formation of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen through the evolution of ideas uncovered in the language, opinion and argument in draft proposals and assembly debates.

Pictured left to right: Jacqueline Kasunic, Kate Sweetapple, and Keith Baker
Kasunic and Sweetapple are also collaborating with Tom Mullaney (History) and Jason Heppler on visual design for Mullaney’s Chinese Input project which traces the routes Chinese typists take via software and hardware to transcribe printed text to electronic text.
CESTA's physical walls and worktables become as much of a working space as do the digital ones

The designers became involved in yet another project during their visit, led by Sarah Ogilvie (Linguistics), looking at the Oxford English Dictionary as a massive global, crowdsourced project.

Pictured left to right: University of California Santa Barbara grad student Tyler Shoemaker and Sarah Olgivie

Humanities + Design supports and encourages complementary research agenda between researchers in visual communication design and researchers in the humanities. The digitization of the materials of humanities research offers humanities researchers an opportunity to explore and manipulate texts in new ways. In each of the projects mentioned above, H+D brings experts in visual and spatial methods together with content experts in the humanities at Stanford to create new knowledge through collaborative design.

MARKUS KRAJEWSKI
Stanford's CIDR (Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research) and CESTA co-hosted guest speaker Markus Krajewski for a talk on his new book, World Projects: Global Information Before WWI.

Participants from both inside and outside of CESTA attend the talk by Markus.

Markus Krajewski is Professor of Media Studies at the University of Basel, Switzerland. He is the author of Paper Machines. About Cards & Catalogs, 1548–1929 (The MIT Press, 2011), Der Diener. Mediengeschichte einer Figur zwischen König und Klient (S. Fischer, 2010)"

He is also developer and maintainer of the bibliography software synapsen—a hypertextual card index (www.verzetteln.de/synapsen). For further information see: gtm.mewi.unibas.ch."
901201_cesta-monthly-newsletter-february-2015.txt_7,WE'RE READY FOR OUR CLOSE-UP,"CESTA and the Humanities Center (http://shc.stanford.edu/) at Stanford have been busy working together on the production of a series of videos about Stanford digital humanities projects. The overall aim is to produce six or seven short, news style video packages about individual projects. Each news video will feature interviews with two or three key people who have worked on the project, such as a humanities scholar, a technical expert, and a student research assistant (grad or undergrad). The videos will be publicized individually, but also presented together on a new Humanities Center webpage about the digital humanities. The last video shoots will be wrapping up very soon.

The Humanities Center DH web page will be used to help promote a capstone public DH discussion event to be held in the Humanities Center on Tuesday, May 5, 2015 from 2 - 3:30pm  The event will explore and address the “what are the digital humanities good for?” question.  the event will feature panelists who have been interviewed for the series of DH videos that have been produced. Stanford scholars and technical experts will talk about their work in the digital humanities in a conversation moderated by Caroline Winterer and Zephyr Frank. The event will be recorded and posted on the Stanford YouTube Channel, and it will be available as a live webcast so people can attend remotely.

A big thank you goes out to Corrie Goldman, Director of Communications at the Humanities Center,  and Sarah Olgivie, Digital Humanities Coordinator at the Humanities Center and CESTA,  for organizing and coordinating the production of these videos, and to all the participants who were willing to step in front of the camera and share a little bit about what has gone into their various projects and efforts.

901201_cesta-monthly-newsletter-february-2015.txt_8,NEW CHAPTERS,"Cameron Blevins is leaving California next month to begin the transition to a post-doc position at Rutgers University. Cameron has worked at the Spatial History Lab and the Literary Lab since he came to Stanford in 2009. As a PhD candidate in the history department, Cameron's dissertation maps the role of the U.S. Post (http://cameronblevins.org/gotp/) in the integration of the American West. He will be joining the Rutgers Center for Historical Analysis (http://rcha.rutgers.edu/)  and, more importantly, his partner Erica Nelson (http://www.astro.yale.edu/enelson/) on the east coast. Cameron bids a bittersweet farewell all of the wonderful people at CESTA (and the California sunshine), but will be making periodic visits back to Stanford over the next several months as he tries to finish his dissertation without getting frostbite. All the best to you, Cameron!"

Hello! My name is Ranjeshni Sharma (Rani) Administrator; I am responsible for the day-to-day operation for CESTA and Worldview Stanford plus management of fourth floor Wallenberg.  I have more than 10 years’ professional experience in business administration with an emphasis on human resources, and employee relations. I’ve been with Stanford University for 7 year now and I love working with students, faculty, researchers. I’m so proud to be a part of the Stanford community.

Outside of my work at Stanford, I enjoy spending time with my family, traveling, working out and cooking.

FREDERICO FREITAS
I am a historian. My research deals with national parks, environmental policy, and the interaction of society and nature in Brazil and Argentina. These are things that take place in space, so I am very interested in using GIS to better understand them. At CESTA I work in the Spatial History Project as the principal investigator of a project, Boundaries of Nature, that gives me the opportunity to place in space the narratives and phenomena I am studying in my PhD dissertation (which I am doing at Stanford’s History Department). I am also a designer. In my hometown Sao Paulo I worked for many years doing motion graphics and animation for small and big screens. At CESTA, I am very interested in using the skills and vocabulary of motion graphics to tell the visual histories that digital humanities scholarship is producing."

1337061_cesta-newsletter-winter-2016.txt_1,Stanford Press Launch of Enchanting the Desert,"A lot has happened with the project Enchanting the Desert since the last CESTA newsletter. Project lead and author Nicholas Bauch has continued working closely with Stanford University Press, as they prepare to unveil the project in the spring of 2016 to introduce the Press’s Mellon-funded Interactive Scholarly Works digital publishing initiative.  Undergraduate Research Assistants Delenn Chin and Frank Zheng continue their dedication to the technical arm of the web development, while Bauch and the Press editors are making final decisions about design, web maintenance, “search engine optimization” (so you can find the project on Google), cataloging the project with the Library of Congress, and other topics involved in the “hand-off.”

You can check out a sneak-peek demonstration of the project here (http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/project.php?id=1061) .

In December 2015, Bauch presented a piece of Enchanting the Desert to the BayGeo (http://www.baama.org/) Holiday Mixer at the Gray Area Grand Theater (http://grayarea.org/theater/overview/) n San Francisco:"
1337061_cesta-newsletter-winter-2016.txt_2,DH Asia: Paul Vierthaler,"Paul Vierthaler, Visiting Associate Professor at Boston College, traveled to CESTA as the very first resident scholar in our DHAsia series directed by Tom Mullaney. From February through May, the DHAsia initiative will bring six researchers to Stanford to discuss their work at the intersection of Digital Humanities and South, East/Southeast, or Central Asia. During their three-day visit, each scholar will host a 45 minute talk, as well as a longer workshop teaching specific tools or methods relevant to their work.

See here for the full DHAsia schedule (http://dhasia.org/2015/10/digital-humanities-asia-stanford-complete-2016-schedule/) .

Talk: Digital Research into the Authorship of Jin Ping Mei

In this inaugural DHAsia lecture, Vierthaler discussed his work using ""stylometrics""—  the study of linguistic style— to do genre research on classical Chinese texts.

In particular, Vierthaler examined the authorship of the late Ming novel the Jin Ping Mei 金瓶梅 (Plum in the Golden Vase). The Plum in the Golden Vase was written pseudonymously by the “Laughing Scholar of Lanling” sometime in the late 1500s or early 1600s; its author's identity has been the subject of intense debate since its initial circulation.

Vierthaler offered new insight with digital methods. Through modeling how the Jin Ping Mei manuscript circulated in elite social networks, he gained new evidence for the work's initial starting point. And through machine learning-based algorithms and other stylometric analysis, he was able to clarify the identity of the author.

Workshop: Stylometrics and Genre Research in Imperial Chinese Studies

Vierthaler also led a hands-on workshop teaching digital methods to analyze variations in Chinese literary texts. The large conference room was packed!

Along the way, Vierthaler gave a crash course in Python to a room full of people without programming experience. After covering the basics, Paul helped participants dive straight into textual analysis. Attendees learned how to prepare Chinese texts for comparison, cleaning up extraneous symbols and dividing texts into chunks of similar length; finally, they learned how to visualize stylistic differences between their texts through code. In just a couple hours, they gained methods for literary inquiry in another language.

“My goal here is for everybody to come away able to adapt these methods to their own texts,” Vierthaler said.

As Tom Mullaney put it in his introduction for Vierthaler, this workshop— and the five more to come— are an opportunity to “roll up our sleeves and jump in with no expectation of prior knowledge. The idea is that the expert lets us into the factory and shows us how the machines work.”"
1337061_cesta-newsletter-winter-2016.txt_3,Stanford Report: Digital Humanities Minor,"An article in the Stanford Report profiled the new Digital Humanities minor (https://dhminor.stanford.edu/) , which launched this Fall. The minor, administered by the English Department, provides a formal academic context for undergraduates to pursue the kind of interdisciplinary, digital-tool-supported inquiry in the humanities that students and faculty are already involved in at both CESTA and the Stanford libraries’ Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research (https://library.stanford.edu/research/center-interdisciplinary-digital-research-cidr) (CIDR).

“By combining scientific and computational methods with interpretative and critical thinking skills, the field of digital humanities opens unprecedented doors to what scholars can achieve,” the article stated, pointing to the broad range of projects underway at CESTA.

As part of the Digital Humnaities minor program, students will select one of three “clusters” to focus in: geospatial humanities, quantitative textual analysis, or text technologies. As the Stanford Report article notes, students will have more than 70 courses (https://dhminor.stanford.edu/dh-courses)  ranging widely across disciplines to choose from.

The article quoted Angelica Previte, a sophomore and RA at CESTA who has enrolled in the new minor. Previte plans to major in computer science.

"""
1337061_cesta-newsletter-winter-2016.txt_4,The minor,"will help me investigate a wider variety of computer science applications than CS department courses alone usually do,"" Previte said. ""Computer science courses provide a set of tools and ways of solving problems, and digital humanities provides an opportunity for a more diverse field of uses for those tools.""

1337061_cesta-newsletter-winter-2016.txt_5,Humanities + Design Launches Breve,"Giovanna Ceserani, Ethan Jewett, and Nicole Coleman from Humanities + Design have launched a new tool called Breve (http://breve.designhumanities.org/)  that helps researchers visualize and begin drawing conclusions from their data. Developed under the Networks in History project (http://hdlab.stanford.edu/)  and funded by a grant from the Office of Digital Humanities (http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh/about) , Breve— like Palladio (http://palladio.designhumanities.org/) , another Humanities + Design data visualization tool— is the product of collaboration between many humanities researchers.

The Breve team says, ""
We designed Breve for researchers who have to work with very incomplete and messy data. Historical data is often full of inconsistencies and errors that can be difficult to see when scrolling through a spreadsheet. We were inspired by Victor Powell's CSV fingerprint (http://t.co/339TNaGrch) , which he describes as a ""birdseye view"" of the file without too much distracting detail. Breve gives you that meta view of tabular data and also lets you drill down to records and columns, and edit values.""

The Breve team plans to incorporate their new tool into Palladio in the future."
1337061_cesta-newsletter-winter-2016.txt_6,CESTA Skills Workshops,"Throughout January and February, experts from around campus held workshops at CESTA to teach digital humanities tools, through short, hands-on sessions accessible to all.

Omeka

Jason Heppler, the Academic Technology Specialist in the Department of History, taught an Introduction to Omeka workshop. The works
hop covered the basics of Omeka, looked at example projects, and led participants through a hands-on session using Omeka.net (http://omeka.net/) .

Python

David McClure, a software engineer at Stanford’s Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research, led “Python for Data Wrangling.” The final result: each participant created a word network mapping links between the words in a novel.

To start off, McClure demonstrated a Python-created visualization for War and Peace that organized the novel’s words into broad thematic clusters. McClure then helped workshop attendees both re-familiarize themselves with Python and create their own simple word network, based on words’ proximity to each other within a text of their choice.

Neatline


McClure also led a workshop on Neatline, a collection of digital mapmaking add-ons for Omeka.

Participants used Neatline to create an interactive, annotated visual based on Charles Minard’s famous map of the 1812 Invasion of Russia, which plotted the deterioration of Napoleon’s army."
1337061_cesta-newsletter-winter-2016.txt_7,Interconnected Histories,"Researchers Allison Ramay and Joanna Crow visited CESTA to present and discuss their project “Interconnected Histories (http://www.bristol.ac.uk/arts/research/interconnected-histories/) ,” which compiles and maps the social networks of three prominent Mapuche intellectuals from early 20^th century Chile: Manuel Manquilef, Manuel Aburto Panguilef, and Venancio Coñuepán. Existing research on these leaders' role in Chile’s history and indigenous rights movement covers their politics but not their social worlds. “Interconnected Histories” will fill that gap.

“Just by looking at the people with whom they interacted, we learned more about who they are,” Ramay explained. Crow and Ramay’s database comes to life in digital visualizations such as spaghetti diagrams of who-knew-who and related details.


""Visualizations really open up the social networks of these people: they allow for ambiguity, for speculation,” Crow said.

Going forward, the researchers hope to create more visuals, including geographic maps. And they are still expanding their database—they called the 180 connections logged so far for Manquilef “just the tip of the iceberg.” They also plan to create a website giving the public access to their work."
1337061_cesta-newsletter-winter-2016.txt_8,Stanford Report: Boundaries of Nature,"The Stanford Report recently featured graduate student and Spatial History Project researcher Frederico Freitas (http://fredericofreitas.org/) ’ work exploring the intertwined history of two borderland national parks in Argentina and Brazil. Freitas found that the parks, established at roughly the same time, were politically motivated: “generated not by noble environmentalism, but rather by the strategic rivalry between the two countries,” the Stanford report article states. Freitas also discovered that Brazil and Argentina’s different approaches to park management reinforced a strong border in the landscape itself.

At CESTA, Freitas digitized over 800 pictures to tell a visual story of the parks’ history, documenting the area’s development from the 1930s through the 2000s. His project “Boundaries of Nature (http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/project.php?id=1077) ” and its maps can be found online (http://cesta.stanford.edu/projects/boundaries/) under the Spatial History Project.

1337061_cesta-newsletter-winter-2016.txt_9,Mark Braude: Speed and Power,"Mark Braude— lecturer in Art History, French, and History— spoke at Cantor Arts Center on its new Speed and Power exhibit, which he curated. Braude’s exhibit explores “the many ways that trains, planes, and automobiles have shaped modern urban life and how artists have integrated the interrelated themes of speed and power into their work.”


At his lecture, Braude discussed how travel technology increased 20th century citizens' pace of living and made speed the ultimate status symbol. Braude also spoke about the rise of photography to capture this fast-moving, speed-loving world.


“What faster means of representation do we have than photography, which was denigrating in its earlier years precisely because it was so quick and easy?” Braude said.

The exhibit will be open through March 21st; you can find more information

1337061_cesta-newsletter-winter-2016.txt_10,"CESTA in San Francisco for ""Platforms: A History of Space""","In January, members of CESTA went up to San Francisco to participate in the three-day event ""Platforms: A History of Space."" (http://www.cca.edu/calendar/2015/platforms-augmented-histories-space)  Organized by California College of the Arts’ Experimental History Project—“an interdisciplinary platform for exhibitions, research, and events exploring experimental practices of architectural and urban history”— January’s event kicked off with a weeklong exhibition of digitally inspired approaches to urban and architectural studies. The event culminated in a Friday symposium in which researchers presented their projects, and a Saturday activity in which participants explored an “augmented” San Francisco with the aid of a variety of apps and online tools.

CESTA’s own Zephyr Frank presented at the Friday symposium. Frank's talk focused on storytelling with digital platforms, showcasing a project (http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/viz.php?id=377&)  that he developed with Erik Steiner and Fred Freitas in the Spatial History Lab. The project seeks to show the social connections among characters in the nineteenth-century Brazilian novel Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas, in both spatial and social network dimensions. Frank, Steiner, and Freitas explored these dimensions through a five minute visualization combining narration, music, maps, photos, and network diagrams."
1337061_cesta-newsletter-winter-2016.txt_11,The History of Place in Cyprus,"Last Fall saw the launch of Stuart Dunn's Cyprus Gazetteer Project (http://www.cyprusgazetteer.org/) , funded by the A. G. Leventis Foundation, at King's College London. The project aims to map and visualize references to place on the island of Cyprus as people's understanding of these places evolved through time. For example, Dunn notes, the Paphos known to Luke the Evangelist has a different character, meaning, and spatial footprint to the Paphos known to Florio Bustorn in the 1570s AD.

The gazetteer platform captures these places' ""footprints"" in quasi-cartographic form and provides what Stuart and the other researchers have termed ""the bibliographic exploration of place,"" capturing the ""attestation"" or precise reference to a place, and any web-visible link to it.

Dunn says, ""CESTA has played a critical role in helping us populate the platform with real content, thus informing the development process throughout, and building up a picture of how one particular class of evidence -- historical maps, especially of the Venetian period-- can fit into such a mode of spatial exploration.""

Dunn built on the Cyprus Gazetteer Project with The Archaeology of Place in Ancient Cyprus (http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/project.php?id=1091) , a part of CESTA's Spatial History Project. The Archaeology of Place in Ancient Cyprus seeks to represent Cypriot archaeology of the prehistoric period, before any contemporary place-names are documented— mapping sites whose contemporary names cannot be known, and whose spatial configuration is often uncertain."
1337061_cesta-newsletter-winter-2016.txt_12,CESTA Research Assistant Social,"One Friday in January, CESTA’s Research Assistants gathered in our Lounge to relax and get to know one another— and to devour four boxes of pizza! Students discussed their interests, traded stories, and laughed a lot; conversation ranged from research projects to favorite classes to shared midterm woes.

CESTA is student-driven. RAs do vital work across labs and projects; CESTA strives to involve students in all areas of the Center and engage them in all sorts of tasks, from data-wrangling to historical research to communications. The pizza gathering was part of an ongoing effort to foster connection among RAs, and to ensure that CESTA is not only a workplace but a strong community. More RA activities to follow in the future— as well as a GroupMe chat for RAs to communicate with each other more easily!"

Her topics range from environmental disasters to the devastation of Araucaria forests to the process of migrations and agriculture.

While visiting CESTA during fall and winter quarter, Nodari studied the transformation of landscapes in Brazil through agriculture, with an emphasis on viticulture, or the production of grapes. Her project (http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/project.php?id=1139) synthesizes data previously analyzed separately, combining spatial data on the ecosystem with data on demographics, land use, and settlement history to investigate how a region developed.

Nodari has published specialized journals and edited collections, book chapters, and books monographs on nature and society in southern Brazil. She is a researcher of the Brazilian National Council of Research (CNPq) as well as a member of the American Society for Environmental History, the European Society for Environmental History, and Sociedad Latinoamericana y Caribeña de Historia Ambiental. She also organized the Simposio Internacional de Historia Ambiental e Migrações, the main meeting of environmental historians in Brazil; the next meeting will take place in Florianopolis in September 2016."
1337061_cesta-newsletter-winter-2016.txt_14,CESTA People Spotlight,"BRIAN JOHNSRUD
Co-director and Lab Manager, Lacuna Stories and Poetic Media Project


Brian is finishing his interdisciplinary degree in Modern Thought and Literature this spring, while also running the Poetic Media Lab in CESTA. Brian's research looks at mediated representations of the past, particularly at how the Crusades have been represented across media in the U.S. and Middle East after 9/11. In the lab, Brian's first project was designing Lacuna, a digital annotation platform used by researchers and in higher education classrooms for collaborative reading, learning, and writing. After completing his Ph.D. this spring, Brian will stay on to co-direct the Poetic Media Lab and its ongoing projects.

Brian grew up in a rural community in Montana, where he also did his undergraduate and first master's degree in Media Studies. Before coming to Stanford, he received a Rhodes Scholarship that sent him to Oxford for a couple years, where he completed two other master's degrees, in medieval literature and cultural anthropology. Since moving to the Bay Area seven years ago, Brian has become enamored with its environs, so he is excited to be staying on at Stanford!

CLARE TANDY
Research Assistant


Hi all! I’m a history fan, card game enthusiast, tea lover, and have been a Research Assistant at CESTA since the middle of fall quarter. I’ve been working on data tagging for the Global Currents project, and I’ve loved being involved with and learning about the project. It’s also been a fantastic opportunity to meet other people who are interested in similar topics and to work collaboratively.

I grew up in the Bay Area, and have been working to balance a desire to fill my academic schedule with everything from Roman Archeology (my nod to Classics after six years of Latin) to Nanotechnology. Outside of class, I love hiking, either around the Dish or Arastradero, and skiing when I make it up to the mountains. I’ve also been known to persuade my friends to learn cribbage, and to stay up entirely too late talking. I’m looking forward to the rest of winter quarter, and hopefully some more beautiful weather!"
1337061_cesta-newsletter-winter-2016.txt_15,Lit Lab Pamphlet #11 Published,"The Literary Lab released the 11^th entry in its popular Pamphlets (http://litlab.stanford.edu/pamphlets/) series, titled “Canon/Archive. Large-scale Dynamics in the Literary Field.” This latest pamphlet asks big questions about how a digital lens has advanced literary inquiry. It begins:

Of the novelties introduced by digitization in the study of literature, the size of the archive is probably the most dramatic: we used to work on a couple of hundred nineteenth-century novels, and now we can analyze thousands of them, tens of thousands, tomorrow hundreds of thousands. It’s a moment of euphoria, for quantitative literary history: like having a telescope that makes you see entirely new galaxies. And it’s a moment of truth: so, have the digital skies revealed anything that changes our knowledge of literature?

The entire pamphlet is available online at  http://litlab.stanford.edu/LiteraryLabPamphlet11.pdf."
1337061_cesta-newsletter-winter-2016.txt_16,"Experiencing George Moses Horton, Slave Poet, Through VR","Cecil Brown is the Chief Researcher for the George Moses Horton Project at CESTA; he also lectures in Urban Studies at Stanford. Brown recently wrote an article on a virtual reality tool on display at the Blacks in Gaming (BIG) party. Read on for a shortened version of Brown's piece:



You have just entered the Blacks In Gaming (BIG) party. To be sure, there are only about two hundred members, compared to the 26,000 white gamers at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco. Still it’s an effort, and a laudable one, too. Sponsored by Xbox, the event is an answer to the Big Parties going on all around you. BIG’s aim is, according to their website, to “spread the message... highlighting the accomplishment of people of color in the video games industry.”

The founder, Mr. Kevin Brown, gave a welcoming at the front of the room.

""Ten years ago, I founded this organization,"" Mr. Brown told us, ""because when I go to the GDC conventions all I ever saw was white people.""

Obama’s TechHire Initiative claims that even when Blacks have degrees in Technology, they still don’t get hired. “Top universities turn out Black and Hispanic computer science and computer engineering graduates at twice the rate that leading technology companies hire them,"" the TechHire website says.

The problem is the lack of exposure to Black developers, Mr. Brown maintained. Some of the reasons why Blacks don’t do well in that when game industry, he told us, is that developers hire people they know, and the people they know are other white men.

The solution, he said, is networking.

""We want you to enjoy meeting each other,"" Mr. Brown said, ""And check out the games.""

The game that got the most attention was one that we might call the George Moses Horton game application. Mr. Elijah Butterfield, 18, had a goggle cardboard box that allowed the viewer to experience virtual reality (VR). For the Black Gamers, these cardboard VR glasses—which mocked the expensive Ocular glasses that are the symbol of the GMC this year—were a hilarious experience.

Yet what made the Gamers stand in line to take a look was not the device itself but the contents of the story: that of George Moses Horton, the slave poet from the antebellum South. Born a slave in North Carolina, Horton was allowed to go to Chapel Hill and sell fruit on Sundays to the young white male students. During this time, Horton picked up enough education to reveal an unusual gift for poetry.

As you look through the cardboard, you are back in the world of the University, and as you are gliding along around the buildings, suddenly, you hear the voice of the oral Poet. As you listen to the poem ""Liberty and Slavery,"" first published in 1829, you see the lyrics floating down from the 3D screen.

""Can you make other subjects like that?” asked Harrison Chastang, a well-known Black journalist and news director at KPOO radio station. “What about the Harlem Renaissance? The Last Poets? What about Baraka?"" he asked, referencing the recently deceased African American poet.

As a social media, the George Moses Horton application made history alive for this “target audience.” It gave 30 or so Black players a chance to experience images of stories that we all wanted to see.

The foundation of innovation is the process that allows one artifact to be repurposed and made to fit a new need. Perhaps Elijah and his new generation have the key. One way to to break the color line is to do what no one has seen before. The gamer who had never heard of George Moses Horton, the slave poet, would now, having seen him through virtual reality, return to reality with a memorable experience.

To resolve the Mason-Dixie line in the Digital World, Black Gamers and Developers are showing the world what they can do.

The talk, ""Spatial History and the Digital Humanities,"" focused on the problems and opportunities inherent in historical GIS projects.  The event also sparked conversation about ways students working in DH at Berkeley could get connected to their peers at Stanford.  Building on this mutual interest, we are in the early stages of planning a series of exchange events for fall 2015.

CESTA recently held a meeting for the inaugural cohort for its new Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities. The first cohort and the GCDH committee met for initial introductions and to discuss how the new GCDH grads will proceed. The cohort plans on reaching out to DH grads at Berkeley along with other graduate programs to find common ground, build relationships, and potential collaborations."

1013993_cesta-newsletter-march-april-2015.txt_4,ROADSHOW,"This February and March CESTA post-doc Nicholas Bauch (http://www.nicholasbauch.com/) took his project – Enchanting the Desert – on a road show, delivering three lectures in southern California, one in Phoenix, one in Portland, and one in Chicago.  The rich conversations with faculty and students at each of these stops could not have been more productive and enjoyable.

In California’s southland, the first stop was at UCLA’s Center for Digital Humanities (http://www.cdh.ucla.edu/ ) followed by UC–Riverside’s Critical Digital Humanities (http://cdh.ucr.edu/) colloquium, then the lecture series at the Art Center College of Design (http://www.artcenter.edu/accd/index.jsp) in Pasadena.  At the College of Design, Bauch served as a guest consultant for some of the students’ MFA thesis projects.

“Whistle stops for Bauch’s lecture tour of Enchanting the Desert.”

Next he traveled to Arizona State University to deliver a lecture to their Schools of Sustainability and Historical Studies (https://schoolofsustainability.asu.edu/) , which was immediately followed by a talk at the Rural West Conference just outside of Portland.  The audio for this talk (and for the whole conference!) is available here (http://ruralwest.stanford.edu/site/conference/2015/audio#) .

To wrap things up for these early 2015 travels, Bauch organized and presented in a session at the annual conference of the Association of American Geographers in Chicago called “Digital Geo-Humanities” (http://meridian.aag.org/callforpapers/program/SessionDetail.cfm?SessionID=22536) , bringing together an international panel of practitioners and theorists who work with DH and geographical representation."

The generation of communal knowledge is not a new phenomenon. In the late nineteenth century, the Oxford English Dictionary solicited volunteers to submit words and their usage for inclusion in the dictionary (1). Carl Becker, writing in 1932 on what was already an old discussion in the historical profession, noted that ""if the essence of history is the memory of things said and done, then it is obvious that every normal person, Mr. Everyman, knows some history."" (2) The historian Jo Guldi's work on participatory mapping shows that urban planners in the middle of the twentieth century attempted to learn from and listen to members of a community.

1013993_cesta-newsletter-march-april-2015.txt_11,PROJECT UPDATES,"The Spatial History Project recently completed an 18 month study of the historical ecology of Stanford’s Searsville Reservoir and Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve. The purpose of the project was to reconstruct the landscape as it may have appeared before major European settlement in the late 1700s to improve our understanding of the historical ecosystems and provide information for future restoration discussions.

Erik Steiner led the project, with student Matt Walter and former CESTA post-doc Maria Santos contributing. You can view a stunning poster of the project in the lab, or check out these before/after views here (http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/Visualizations/JasperRidge/west_view.html)  and here (http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/Visualizations/JasperRidge/south_view.html)  of the 3D natural landscape model.

The project was developed as part of Stanford’s three year study investigating environmental restoration alternatives for Searsville Dam. The 125-year-old dam in the preserve stands today as a controversial structure intimately linked to the ecosystems in and around San Francisquito Creek. Some two million cubic yards of trapped sediment has helped create a rich upstream wetland habitat for bat and bird species, but it has also nearly filled the reservoir and the dam blocks steelhead trout from returning to their historic spawning areas. Stanford is weighing several alternatives to establish a sustainable equilibrium for the future and will announce their proposed plan in May.

NICHOLAS BAUCH

Hi everyone!  I am a post-doctoral scholar here on campus with a joint appointment at CESTA and the Bill Lane Center for the American West.  Though my intellectual interests span the breadth of the humanities - from art to environment to history - my background is in cultural geography, a discipline in which I hold all my formal degrees.  I am in love with the concept of landscape, as it offers a very human scale of experiencing and representing our home, the Earth.  To me there's no such thing as a boring landscape; transforming the vernacular into the spectacular is a practice upon which I continually strive to improve through writing and the creation of beautiful design.  More specifically, I am in love with desert landscapes, and and such you may find it no surprise that the title of my major project is Enchanting the Desert: The production of visual space at the Grand Canyon.  I feel lucky that my work and affections are so closely aligned at this point in my life.
Nonetheless, one cannot work all the time.  When I'm not working on my projects I like to cook wildly complicated meals with my wife, Brenda, swim laps, smell the Santa Cruz Mountains, and consume baseball on radio, TV, and in person. In fact, over the past two years I've been one of the radio broadcasters for Stanford's baseball team; check us out on KZSU, 90.1 FM!

MAY PETERSON
Hi! I'm May, a sophomore at Stanford and a proud undergraduate research assistant at CESTA. I've been working with Sarah Ogilvie on her project about the creation of Oxford English Dictionary, ""Nineteenth Century Crowdsourcing,"" since this fall. As Classics major studying Latin literature, and a Medieval Studies minor, I'm also interested in archaeology and I hope to work in education. My hobbies include drawing, reading... and now deciphering nineteenth-century handwriting. I absolutely love the community and intellectual engagement that comes with working at CESTA!

2408617_cesta-newsletter-spring-2017.txt_4,"New Program Assistant, Amanda Wilson Bergado","Amanda Wilson Bergado portrait CESTA is proud to announce the addition of Amanda Wilson Bergado, who joins us to assist with event planning, communications, and the Research Assistant program. A Monterey County native, Amanda attended UC San Diego where she double-majored in History and Political science, focusing on East Asia and International Relations. At graduate school at UC Santa Cruz, she specialized in late 19th and early 20th century U.S. history. Her research examined discourses of deviancy of Chinese migrants and criminality within Chinatowns during the era of Chinese Exclusion.

This will be Amanda’s second time working on Stanford’s campus. Prior to graduate school, she worked at the Freshman Dean's Office and Undergraduate Advising and Research (https://undergrad.stanford.edu/advising) . Amanda’s professional expertise largely centers on project management, event coordination, and communications. As a historian, she is trained in more traditional archival research, including utilizing immigration, municipal, court, and prison records as well as newspapers and genealogical sources. Even before joining CESTA, Amanda followed the news from some of CESTA's projects from afar, notably the Chinese Railroad Workers in North America project (https://cesta.stanford.edu/projects-labs/core-research-groups/chinese-railroad-workers-north-america) . “I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to work in a space that so aptly integrates my intellectual passions with my professional experience,” says Amanda.

Amanda is incredibly talented and kind. We couldn’t be more excited that she’s here."

2408617_cesta-newsletter-spring-2017.txt_6,Looking Beyond Imagining San Francisco: What Urban History Looks Like in Practice,
2408617_cesta-newsletter-spring-2017.txt_7,By Ocean Howell,"Imagined San Francisco is a website that allows visitors to understand why the City-by-the-Bay looks the way it does and how it might have looked differently. With a digital platform, one can not only include more images, but can also layer, manipulate, and analyze them. Imagined San Francisco (https://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/project.php?id=1141) traces the history of urban planning in San Francisco, placing special emphasis on unrealized plans. Rather than using visual material simply to illustrate outcomes, Imagined San Francisco uses historical maps, architectural renderings, and photographs to show what might have been. By enabling users to layer a series of urban plans, the project presents the city not only as a sequence of material changes, but also as a contingent process and a battleground for political power.
When I look at urban plans for San Francisco across the course of the twentieth century, I'm struck by how ambitious and dedicated the city's planners were. (Even though I think some of the specific proposals were terrible ideas!) Every time I hear a discussion about the nation's crumbling infrastructure, I can't help but think that we would do well to remember what we were able to accomplish when there was political will and a commitment to the public good.

In the course of my research, I’ve tracked down hundreds of historical urban plans—plans for transportation, housing, office space, industrial districts, public buildings, recreation space, and more. Most of these plans had multiple iterations, each slightly different than the other. For the sake of clarity when analyzing these iterations, I’d often have to select only one; otherwise, the site would become overwhelming and cluttered. That clarity does have a cost; tracking all of the small changes reveals a lot of texture, a lot of the nitty-gritty about how the planning process actually works. As comprehensive as Imagined San Francisco is, there’s a surprising amount that you don’t get to see.

Urban history is a field that relies on visual materials: maps, plans, photographs, architectural renderings, and more. Digital tools allow scholars to conduct more robust analysis of these materials, and they also offer more options for presenting research. Given the advantages in the cost of dissemination, and given the changing reading habits of the American public, digital platforms also hold out the promise of bringing scholarly research to a wider audience.

There are two types of sources that I would love to see digitized: fire insurance maps and city directories. The old Sanborn Fire Insurance maps (https://www.loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps/about-this-collection/) documented American cities, down to the level of individual structures, at roughly 10-year intervals from the late-nineteenth century into the 1950s. They give the researcher a very granular view of how a city changed over time. Unfortunately, they are cumbersome and difficult to use. Historical city directories link people, businesses, and institutions to specific addresses at yearly intervals. But like the Sanborn maps, they are difficult to work with. No matter how familiar you become with the source base, the going is always slow, and there's only so much you can hope to accomplish. However, if both of these source bases were digitized, we would be able to reproduce fine-grained social geographies by running simple queries. These tools would be even more
powerful when paired with the census data that has already been digitized. For Imagined San Francisco, these tools would allow me to show, with much greater precision, exactly who was going to be affected by specific plans; they might also provide some insight into why certain plans were floated to begin with. But the applications would extend far beyond my own project, and could revolutionize the field of urban history."
2408617_cesta-newsletter-spring-2017.txt_8,Delivering the Digital Humanities: A Conversation with Rachel Midura,"Rachel Midure Portrait Here at Stanford University since 2014, Rachel Midura is a PhD Candidate in History working on her dissertation, ""The Published Courier: The Culture of the Post, 1500-1700."" At CESTA, Rachel is studying 16th century Milanese Post Master Ottavio Codogno’s postal itinerary. With the chance to ask Rachel a few questions, we wanted to know more about what it means to study a postal itinerary and how and why she does it within the digital humanities realm.

CESTA: Hi Rachel. So tell us, what exactly is a postal itinerary and why did you choose to focus on Ottavio Codogno’s?

Rachel Midura: In 1608, Milanese lieutenant postmaster Ottavio Codogno’s Nuovo itinerario delle poste per tutto il mondo first went to press. The postal itinerary exemplified a popular early modern genre that sought to familiarize users with the times, distances, costs, and customs of an increasingly pan-European postal network. The booklets—small enough to fit in one’s hand—also represent the adaptiveness and interactivity of seventeenth-century print materials. This project seeks to advance those traits to a new digital presentation. Just as travelers once planned the routes for their goods, letters, and increasingly, themselves, so too can the user of ""Ottavio Codogno's Itinerary"" plan virtual trips across Europe and the world.

CESTA: Wow, all that? It sounds like the most in-the-know travel guide ever.

RM:"
2408617_cesta-newsletter-spring-2017.txt_9,Laughs,"I guess you could say that.

CESTA: We’re curious, what are some of the interesting findings that have come up in your research—that won’t necessarily make it to the final project—that you’ve found most compelling?

RM: While the dissertation is still at its initial stages, I began reading postal itineraries as a part of a second-year seminar paper. I was familiar with the utility of DH visualization as a means of reading across dense reference texts, particularly from my work with the Grand Tour project. I designed a database that would help me parse the seventeenth-century “tabular data,” and reinterpret it with dynamic visualization. The greatest surprise was how naturally the information transferred from one form to the other, which brought home the effectiveness of the original text technology. Additionally, when I set up the initial comparison between the 1608 and 1623 editions, I expected to see the impact of the political and religious conflict of the Thirty Years’ War as new obstacles and more sharply defined borders. Instead, I found preliminary evidence for the opposite—war fostered newer, longer communication networks. This has impacted my transnational, cultural approach to
a topic usually treated in the context of increasing European divisiveness.

CESTA: It’s amazing to see the way visualization changes how we see things. What are some of the most vital tools that you use?

RM: The database was built from my experience working with tabular data and Palladio (http://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/) , while I used my new knowledge of some R programming language to build the Shiny website (https://rmidura.shinyapps.io/Codogno/) . Moving forward, I hope to gain inspiration and feedback from spatial historians and cartographers as I experiment with “distorted” maps to represent more accurately the early modern experience of the post.

Explore possible routes and destinations of the Imperial Post through Rachel's webpage (https://rmidura.shinyapps.io/Codogno/) .
CESTA: What is the biggest challenge facing you right now?

RM: The biggest challenge stems from the same place as my commitment to the digital humanities. I am dedicated to the digital curation, annotation, and visualization of the vast resources resulting from worldwide digitization efforts. Historians and humanists more widely have the training to separate the good data from the bad, and at the same time, we stand to benefit the most from new horizons of research. However, it remains difficult to balance a traditional career path with these new opportunities, and so I am always thinking about ways to better integrate the world of the digital humanities with that of the traditional academe.

CESTA: We promised to keep it quick, Rachel, thank you for your time.

RM: It’s been a pleasure.

Rachel will be headed to Washington D.C. in July to take part in the Early Modern Digital Agendas (http://folgerpedia.folger.edu/EMDA_2017) session led by CESTA alumna Ruth Ahnert and Jonathan Hope."
2408617_cesta-newsletter-spring-2017.txt_10,Mapping Old Regimes of Movement,
2408617_cesta-newsletter-spring-2017.txt_11,By Luca Scholz,"Luca Scholtz portrait
Calls to restrict human migration, to regulate the circulation of capital, or to promote the free trade of some goods while banning that of others shape political agendas around the globe. The ordering of movement has become one of the most controversial issues of our day. From the migration of refugees to calls for trade restrictions and capital controls, we are witnessing fundamental changes in the way our societies administer rights of passage.

The regimes of movement that connect and fracture our societies have a history. My spatial history project at CESTA, ""Mapping Old Regimes of Movement,"" tries to visualize the spatial history of sovereignty and human mobility within and beyond old-regime Europe. Control over the movement of goods and persons—from the Spanish treasure fleet to the English poor laws—was a key concern for old-regime societies. In the complex array of ill-defined, overlapping political entities that characterized the pre-modern world, neighboring authorities, local communities, and transient populations frequently competed with each other. Through maps and other visualizations, the project shows that flows of goods and people often shaped early modern states more than these states could shape these flows themselves.

My project relies heavily on digital mapping tools and GIS in particular. We use QGIS to georeference and digitize older maps and merge contemporary data with data compiled from edited and archival sources. Our aim is to understand space not in absolute terms, but rather to take into account the experience of mobile populations and their real potential for using space at different times and under different conditions. Currently, the biggest challenge we are facing is to devise more creative ways of visualizing patterns of mobility in space. Until now, we have mostly relied on GIS, which is limited by its simplistic conception of space and favors a quantitative approach. In the coming years, I intend to develop a broader range of visualization techniques that are more amenable to qualitative analysis.

In all this, the research assistants who joined my project through CESTA’s RA program (https://cesta.stanford.edu/programs/undergraduate-programs) were of invaluable help. Not only did they help with the various tasks a project like this involves (such as data curation, georeferencing, and digitizing), but they also made important intellectual contributions, noting spatial patterns that would have gone unnoticed or bringing in their technical expertise, such as when Madison used her skills in R to determine the ideal class intervals for one of our visualizations.

A project like this would be impossible without the use of GIS, and, indeed, digital tools have become a key element of many research projects in history. Though most historians make at least some use of digital tools, and be it only a reference management software, many scholars remain skeptical towards using more digital tools in their research. I believe that at this point, the most important challenge for digital humanists is asking meaningful research questions and showing that digital tools can help to provide adequate answers to those questions. Indeed, digital humanities research is at its best when it manages to marry relevance and technical innovation. At a time in which digital tools affect virtually every aspect of our lives, those scholars who meet this challenge intelligently will form the spearhead of their disciplines."

781361_cesta-monthly-newsletter-jan-2015.txt_2,DIGITAL PUBLISHING,"Thus far January has been exciting for Enchanting the Desert (http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/project.php?id=1061) .  After nearly three years of work at CESTA and the Bill Lane Center for the American West, Stanford University Press has officially announced that Enchanting is the pilot project for its new digital publishing initiative.  You can read about the Press’s initiative in a series of blog posts on their website HERE (http://bit.ly/14XMa8B) (including one by the author), and you can read about the Mellon Foundation grant that is funding the initiative HERE (http://stanford.io/1xiWEVQ) .  The news has taken the Digital Humanities Twitter-sphere by storm, and the Enchanting team will be thrilled to publicly unveil its work later in 2015.

For those unfamiliar with the project, Enchanting the Desert is a historical geography of the 40 landscape photographs included in Henry Peabody’s circa 1905 slideshow of the Grand Canyon.  Peabody was a prominent commercial photographer who sold his slideshows around the United States, setting a visual template for what one would see when one saw the Grand Canyon.  Through mapping software including ArcGIS, Natural Scene Designer, and Google Earth, the team has reconstructed Peabody’s images from the god’s-eye view, showing what specific areas of the Grand Canyon were visually consumed by real and virtual tourists.  Peabody’s materials are brought into a digital, interactive medium (a web app) so that readers can query the historical details of the places that appear in the slideshow.  While explicating the produced visual space of this slideshow, the project goes further, delving deep into the place-based history of the Canyon.  Frequently misconceived as a single place,
the Grand Canyon is better thought of as a large region composed of thousands of places, each with their own history and human significance.

Thanks to generous support from the Bill Lane Center (http://west.stanford.edu/) and Stanford’s Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education (https://undergrad.stanford.edu/about) , Enchanting the Desert will be hiring a second undergraduate research assistant for the spring and summer terms in 2015.

781361_cesta-monthly-newsletter-jan-2015.txt_4,IT'S COMPLICATED,"For those who don’t know, CESTA has been engaged in a major Andrew W. Mellon Foundation research project on the topic of crowdsourcing for the past two years.  We have sought to answer questions about the opportunities and challenges associated with crowdsourcing in humanities research by conducting three concurrent experimental projects. We can safely say that the answer is: “it’s complicated.”  If you use crowdsourcing for a humanities project, you are not likely to end up exactly where you started, which can be a rewarding thing. With our Historypin partners (https://www.historypin.org) we have collected material for our three sub-projects (please visit our website (http://humanitiescrowdsourcing.stanford.edu) and explore our Historypin sites for Year of the Bay (https://www.historypin.org/project/22-yearofthebay) , Living with the Railroads (https://www.historypin.org/project/42-railroads) , and The Emotions of London).  We are now engaged in the process of analyzing the
data as to the original sub-project research questions, so our conclusions are yet to be determined.  Indeed, the projects are still live, still gathering more information. We can, however, say that crowdsourcing has great potential, but expectations need to be tempered.  If you want to be successful, three things are key: (1) digitally based crowdsourcing isn’t only digital – you must be prepared, in most cases, to put time in meeting and interacting with the community you want to engage; (2) you need a clear, but flexible, goal; and (3), you must learn about and know your crowd. Understanding the community you want to engage with creates your best chance for success.  Initial white papers will be coming soon (and will be available on the project website).

Open Design is part of the development strategy for the Palladio toolset created by Humanities+Design at CESTA. The idea is to make the tools available at very early stages of development to let researchers use them and then tell us what works and what doesn’t. The simple goal is to make data visualization tools designed from the ground up to work for humanities research. As a result, Palladio has earned a committed user community within its first year. Among those users are historians at the State Department. In December, Tom Faith and Joe Wicentowski (pictured in a Skype meeting at CESTA) presented how they use Palladio as a search/exploration/presentation tool for the Foreign Relations of the United States data at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, US Department of State. Our own Mark Braude was there, too, to give an overview of the work going on at CESTA and within H+D.

The Literary Lab is pleased to announce the publication of its 8^th pamphlet: “Between Canon and Corpus: Six Perspectives on 20^th-Century Novels” by Mark Algee-Hewitt and Mark McGurl. The study takes on the difficulties of assembling a corpus of 20^th -century works, a task that has long proven difficult for the quantitative study of literature due to the copyright regulations that cover most works published after the 1920s and the sheer number of texts that have been published in the last 115 years. Seeking a middle ground between a truly “random” sample and a purely canonical sample, Algee-Hewitt and McGurl explore the possibility of a modular corpus, which acknowledges its own limitations and biases by leveraging the social phenomenon of “best of” lists that appeared at the end of the 20^th century. Beginning with five such lists (“The Modern Library Editors’ Best Books of the 20^th Century”, “The Modern Library Readers’ Best Books,” the “Radcliffe Rivals List”,
“McCaffery’s Best Experimental Fiction” and the “Publishers Weekly” list of bestselling yearly books in the 20^th century) Algee-Hewitt and McGurl employ a network analysis that graphically demonstrates the formation of a canon along the dual axes of critical prestige and wide popularity.

The study also delves into the question of representation as it seeks to redress the striking gender and ethnicity balance in these lists by conducting its own experiment in creating a crowd-sourced “best of” list, compiled by through a questionnaire sent to members of the Post-Colonial Studies Association. This experiment not only provided yet another module to add to the Lab’s 20^th century Corpus, but also gave the authors an opportunity to delve into questions of representation and sampling, particularly within the context of contemporary literary studies. Does the canon still hold value for creating corpora of texts to study digitally, or are there other ways to conceive of a sample of 20^th century texts that would be sensitive to concerns over biases inherent in the writing and publishing worlds themselves? The pamphlet is the Lab’s first attempt to grabble seriously with this issue and, in doing so, it opens up a new area of study in the Digital Humanities.

781361_cesta-monthly-newsletter-jan-2015.txt_14,PERSPECTIVES,"Digital impact on historical writing and learning

Thomas Nygren, visiting scholar of CESTA, has recently devoted some extra attention to the writing of history in digital environments, highlighting potentials and challenges in a digital era.

His article ‘Students Writing History Using Traditional and Digital Archives’ (http://etjanst.hb.se/bhs/ith/3-12/tn.htm) describes how the materiality of sources and archives may influence how senior high school students write about the past. How sources in digital databases can stimulate a quantitative approach whereas traditional archives may stimulate a more hermeneutical interpretation of sources and a more explicit theoretical position. Thomas was also involved in constructing a digital platform to support multi-perspectivity and media critical thinking in history teaching. This site (https://media.sodis.de/ehisto/en/index.html) helps students and teachers to identify multiple perspectives on Columbus (https://media.sodis.de/ehisto/columbus/multinational_columbus/en/multiple_perspectives.html) and the start of World War I (https://media.sodis.de/ehisto/wwI/multinational_wwI/en/multiple_perspectives.html) by using popular history, written by historians from five different
countries.

Thomas has also in collaboration with digital scholars of ancient history (Anna Foka) and archaeology (Philip I. Buckland), presented  how the digital humanities and digital history in Sweden (http://www.hsozkult.de/hfn/debate/id/diskussionen-2402) have number of interesting outcomes and projects in a tradition dating back to the 1960’s. In this overview they display constructive uses of digital materials and tools and how critical perspectives are quite common in digital historical research. But they also find that the research would benefit from being more experimental in the use of digital tools.

In Umeå in December, Thomas argued that core competencies in the digital humanities take time and effort to win. In DH scholars and students must have humanistic eye on the world; abilities to criticize information, empathize with different human perspectives and be able to create new insights (see illustration below of ‘dh.school’ mindsets presented at Genres of Scholarly Knowledge Production (http://www.humlab.umu.se/en/events/archive/genres-of-scholarly-knowledge-production/goskp-program/) )."
781361_cesta-monthly-newsletter-jan-2015.txt_15,DIGITAL HISTORY,"Digital History at the AHA

At the American Historical Association's Annual Meeting in New York January 2-5, 2015, workshops, sessions, panels, and events on digital history (http://historians.org/annual-meeting/resources-and-guides/digital-history-at-the-annual-meeting) abounded. There were many sessions (http://historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/november-2014/a-web-of-history) focusing on the application of digital methods to history, including presentations from CESTA's own Cameron Blevins (https://aha.confex.com/aha/2015/webprogram/Session12203.html) and Jason Heppler (https://aha.confex.com/aha/2015/webprogram/Session12163.html) .

You can read more about Molly's research and their early attempts at visualizing consumption at the Humanities+Design lab notebook (http://hdlab.stanford.edu/lab-notebook/palladio/2014/11/03/Taylor-Poleskey/) ."
781361_cesta-monthly-newsletter-jan-2015.txt_16,VISITORS,"Ethan Blue (http://www.uwa.edu.au/people/ethan.blue) , a Senior Lecturer in History at the University of Western Australia, has been visiting CESTA for the past two weeks.  Though his previous work concentrated on the history of American prisons (Doing Time in the Depression: Everyday Life in Texas and California Prisons, NYU Press, 2012), he is collaborating with CESTA researchers to map the history US “Deportation Special” trains.  These trains made constant circuits through the country in the early twentieth century, picking up and then ejecting so-called “undesirable aliens” – non-citizens convicted of crimes, deemed mad or politically radical, the very poor, or else those considered racially ineligible to citizenship, many Chinese among them.  The project reconstructs the social world of the deportation trains by reassembling their passenger lists, tracing the deportees’ migratory routes and experiences, and then examining how they were captured and expelled by the
nascent deportation regime; an assemblage that would only grow in the century that followed."

GABRIEL WOLFENSTEIN

Hi, I’m Gabriel K. Wolfenstein, the Project Manager and Researcher for two of CESTA’s big projects: the Andrew W. Mellon Crowdsourcing and the Humanities project, and, jointly with History and American Studies, the Chinese Railroad Workers Project.   I am a historian by training; my Ph.D. is in British History and the History of Science.  I work on, among other things, the history of statistics and the census, the popularization of science, the history of the railroads, and crowdsourcing.  Here at CESTA, I help make sure the projects that I work on move forward, by making sure that all moving parts (researchers, technology, partners inside and outside the University, etc.) work smoothly together.  I also pursue research on the projects that I work on, ranging from questions regarding the value of crowdsourcing to seeking out traces of Chinese railroad workers in the 19th century legal world. Within CESTA, I also help Matt Bryant and Celena Allen maintain lab cheeriness.
Outside of CESTA, I am a political news junkie, read avidly, and enjoy regular pub quiz.

MATT BRYANT
Howdy, I'm Matt Bryant, and I am the center manager and communications coordinator for CESTA. I work on a variety of things around the center such as social media (including this monthly newsletter!), general administration and lab space logistics, coordinating technology purchases and support, assisting with grants and budgeting, staffing, events, and generally being the interface between the researchers and the larger financial and administrative structures across campus. I work closely with the Center's director on general operational issues and both the short term/long term vision for shaping how the Center will run. Much of what we do around here truly is a village effort, most of which is tag-teamed by me and my amazing fellow staff, all of whom make this place tick and a really great place to work. My role has shifted and evolved over time since it was created when CESTA first came into being almost three years go. All of the individual labs that make up CESTA have of
course been around for much longer than that! It's been very rewarding to watch CESTA change and grow over the years.

When I am not at CESTA, I enjoy riding and wrenching on motorcycles, woodworking, modern alt-country and Americana music, hiking, camping, traveling, occasional volunteer work, and quality time with friends and family. I've been married to my wonderful wife Julia for ten years, and we have two fuzzy felines plus a three-legged rescued cattle dog name Rudy. I have an MFA in Visual Art from the University of California, Riverside and an MA in Communication from U.C. San Diego. I have worked in various fields over the years, including the fine arts world, non-profits, architecture and engineering, woodworking, and of course academia. I'm originally from Texas, but eventually landed in California by way of Minneapolis, MN. If we haven't met and you're ever on campus, drop by and say howdy.

1147037_cesta-newsletter-may-july-2015.txt_2,HUMANITIES + DIGITAL TOOLS,"The Stanford Humanities Center (http://shc.stanford.edu/about) and the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (http://cesta.stanford.edu/) (CESTA) at Stanford recently co-hosted a public event and produced a series of very nice videos collectively called Humanities + Digital Tools (http://shc.stanford.edu/events/humanities-digital-tools) .

From visualizations of complex information and interactive teaching platforms to digitization projects and textual analysis, humanities scholars across campus are harnessing the power of digital tools to push the boundaries of their research. Likewise, the unique properties of humanities scholarship are pushing the boundaries of digital tools.
CESTA Director Zephyr Frank, Text Technologies Director Elaine Treharne,
and Department of History Chair Paula Findlen
The panel discussion included Stanford scholars and technical experts who spoke about their work in the digital humanities, and was moderated by Humanities Center Director Caroline Winterer and CESTA Director Zephyr Frank.

The Stanford Humanities Center has also produced a series of very nice videos that feature particular Stanford digital humanities projects. A big thank you to Corrie Goldman, Director of Humanities Communication, for making the public discussion event and videos happen. To see all the videos and to access an archived link to the webcast of the public event mentioned above, go HERE. (http://shc.stanford.edu/humanities-digital-tools)"
1147037_cesta-newsletter-may-july-2015.txt_3,LACUNA STORIES,"Brian Johnsrud and Daniel Bush, both Phd researchers in CESTA's Poetic Media Lab, attended the University of Victoria's Digital Humanities Summer Institute, for a week of ""Drupal for Digital Humanists."" Look out for a couple new projects in the lab being launched soon as a result of this great week!

Amir Eshel and Brian Johnsrud received a Stanford Hoagland Award for Innovations in Undergraduate Education. This grant, along with a seed grant from the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning, will support the launch of a new project in the Poetic Media Lab: Poetic Thinking. Poetic Thinking will be a learning and research platform that will provide students, instructors, and researchers with the tools, resources, and instruction to critically analyze and creatively construct media. The platform's design and affordances will promote users to analyze and respond to imaginative works creatively in ways that challenge the confines of the traditional argumentative essay."
1147037_cesta-newsletter-may-july-2015.txt_4,ENCHANTING THE HUMANITIES,"On May 5, the Stanford Humanities Center (SHC) hosted a roundtable panel with the theme “Humanities + Digital Tools.”  The panel included a number of projects and speakers from the CESTA community, including Enchanting the Desert.  In preparation for the roundtable, Enchanting author Nicholas Bauch worked closely with the Humanities Center communications team – led by Corrie Goldman – to produce a seven-minute video that would spark conversation about the role of digital humanities on the Stanford campus and beyond.

Video made by the Stanford Humanities Center to promote Enchanting the Desert for
their May roundtable panel discussion about digital humanities on campus.

The subsequent write-up for the May 5 event (http://shc.stanford.edu/digital-humanities) , featuring other CESTA projects including Geography of the Post, Lacuna Stories, and Palladio, was represented on the home landing page of Stanford University with a photograph of Enchanting undergraduate research assistant Delenn Chin, along with Bauch.

Stanford’s home page featured two members of the Enchanting the Desert team – Delenn Chin and Nicholas Bauch – as Chin
explains some of the finer points of programming the interactive map to Bauch.  The image linked to an article about the
broader role of digital humanities at Stanford.
At the end of May, the Enchanting team conducted its first formal, large-group user testing event.  Orchestrated by Bauch, with the advice of CESTA member Brian Johnsrud, the event was beautifully emceed by CESTA DH Coordinator Sarah Ogilvie.  With 20 participants broken into teams, the two-hour’s worth of feedback has been invaluable in the subsequent design of the project’s web application, set for its initial official review with Stanford University Press at the end of August.

Participants in Enchanting’s first formal user testing event offered insights that only a robust community
of digital humanities scholars could have.  Their feedback has already proven extremely useful.

Finally, a special and continued thanks to the Enchanting team programmers, undergraduate research assistants Delenn Chin and Frank Zheng.  Both part of Stanford’s CS-Plus major; Delenn is a Computer Science + Linguistics major, and Frank is a Computer Science + History major.  They are each the heart and lifeblood of the project."
1147037_cesta-newsletter-may-july-2015.txt_5,ROME PROJECT RECEIVES GRANT,"The Forma Urbis Project team has received a grant from the Kress Foundation to digitize and publish some 3,000 images from the archives of Rodolfo Lanciani in Rome. This corpus of images is comprised of drawings, engravings, and photographs, many of which are one-of a-kind exemplars, and some of which have never been published before and represent the source material used by Lanciani to create his famous archeological map of the city. The Stanford, University of Oregon and Dartmouth College team seeks to republishing Lanciani's map in a seamless digital interactive form.  This grant will provide a wealth of primary source material on the archeology of the city."
1147037_cesta-newsletter-may-july-2015.txt_6,HUMANITIES + DESIGN,"Writing Rights goes to Rotterdam!

The Writing Rights team (Keith Baker, Dan Edelstein, Nicole Coleman, Jacqueline Kasunic, Kate Sweetapple) will be presenting their research on the writing of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen at the end of the month at Rotterdam. The project brings faculty from the School of Design at the University of Technology at Sydney together with Stanford faculty to explore the art and process of writing a revolutionary document. Writing Rights draws upon draft declaration proposals as well as the blow-by-blow record of the Assembly debates during what must have been a very hot August in Paris (see the French Revolution Digital Archive (http://frda.stanford.edu/) ).

This is the inaugural project of Humanities + Design’s new initiative to bring design researchers and humanities researchers together to pursue complementary research agenda around a shared topic. Much of this project has happened remotely, via regular video conferences and occasional in person meetings. It will all come together for two panels at the 14th International Congress for Eighteenth-Century Studies. Watch this space for a post-conference update."
1147037_cesta-newsletter-may-july-2015.txt_7,VISITING SCHOLARS,We'd like to introduce you to some of the visitors who are working in CESTA over the summer in various capacities...
1147037_cesta-newsletter-may-july-2015.txt_8,CHERYL GILGE,"Cheryl Gilge received her PhD from the College of Built Environments at the University of Washington. Her dissertation research focused on the user practices of Google Street View, and examined the tensions between socio-cultural and political-economic forces of Google’s production and the way in which users adopt its tools.

As a further extension of her dissertation research, her summer project in CESTA focuses on developing a web platform to capture the user stories that surface from the idiosyncratic visual platform of Street View. Through open-ended narratives, the underlying goal of the project is to capture critical qualitative information regarding how this wayfinding tool influences how we understand the built environment and develop sense of place as a result."
1147037_cesta-newsletter-may-july-2015.txt_9,BENJAMIN HEIN,"Benjamin Peter Hein is completing a PhD in modern European and global history at Stanford. He is interested in the histories of Atlantic mass migration, European industrialization, and global economic development at the end of the nineteenth century. His research focuses on questions of political economy and the relationships between culture and economic history. Before coming to Stanford, Benjamin studied history and economics at Emory University and completed a thesis that explored identity politics among German and Polish coal miners in Germany's industrial Ruhr Valley. After earning his BA, he spent a year developing Emory University’s relationships with numerous social justice organizations in greater metropolitan Atlanta, GA.

Benjamin has worked at CESTA since spring 2015 as the principal investigator of the “Geographies of Capital” project. Drawing on historical data from private banks headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany, this project traces the geographical evolution of Frankfurt’s financial hinterland during the peak period of industrialization, 1860-1900. The project promises to offer new insight about the historical origins of a greater European economy. It also offers a spatial interpretation of German-American capital and debt relations at a time when the German Empire and the United States were the world’s two fastest-growing emerging economies."
1147037_cesta-newsletter-may-july-2015.txt_10,DOUGLAS LIBBY,"Douglas Libby is Professor of History at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais.  His research has focused on multiple aspects of slave societies in he Americas, particularly in Brazil.

This summer he is currently working on his own project comparing the burnt districts of Baltimore and San Francisco after their fires in the early 20th Century. By measuring the differences in lot size, building material, and business locations between the two cities, Jack hopes to be able to shed more light on the spatial dynamics of cities during this era. Back at Penn State, he has been working on a project to the map the relationship between the early suburbs of Baltimore and the expansion of the streetcar system from 1890-1920. Outside of the lab he enjoys reading, Netflix, collecting license plates, and of course Penn State sports."

Awhile in the U.S. under the auspices of the Brazilian government, he is researching at CESTA, working from May/2015 until July/2015 with the Spatial History Project. His focus is based on the development of the city of Rio de Janeiro during the XIX century."
1147037_cesta-newsletter-may-july-2015.txt_14,THE FOREST FOR THE TREES,"Stanford History graduate student and CESTA researcher George Philip LeBourdais currently has an exhibit up through July 20 at the Cantor Art Museum, entitled Arboreal Architecture: A Visual History of Trees. His exhibit was recently featured in the Stanford News:

The exhibition gathers an eclectic range of artwork that spans thousands of years from the museum's collections, including a sixth-century Egyptian medallion, a lukasa memory board from the Republic of Congo and a lithograph of a tree colored in by young Leland Stanford Jr.

LeBourdais organized this new exhibit to investigate ""the tree-like structures of knowledge that help us make sense of the world by providing visual models that teach basic ideas like growth and connection,"" citing the idea of the ""family tree"" as a popular example of the concept.

Arboreal Architecture serves as a natural extension of LeBourdais' ongoing scholarship to explore, from an art historical perspective, the line between nature and culture as both ""chasm"" and ""bridge.""

ERIK STEINER

Yeaux peeps! I’m a geographer, designer, lazy programmer, and “creative” director at CESTA where I’ve been trying to get to the bottom of stuff since 2007. I work on a wide range of projects through my role in Spatial History, and have a special interest in projects that blend empirical and humanistic methods and are bound together by design. My soul type is “lover-creator” which values strong interpersonal connections and a desire to realize a vision. I feel incredibly blessed that I can fulfill both goals through our collaborations at CESTA.

Outside of the lab… I am an east coast transplant who lives in Eugene, Oregon with my wife Bethany (who teaches at the University of Oregon) and our kids Sabine (“older than 4 and a half”) and Jasper (almost 2). Since becoming a Dad, my former hobbies of triathlon, canoeing, backpacking, have been replaced by toy tinkering, bedtime chaos, and fort building. That and home ownership: I can repair a washing machine, dig an irrigation trench, and prune an apple tree like the best of them."

1147037_cesta-newsletter-may-july-2015.txt_20,SUMMER RESEARCH ASSISTANTS,"We have a lot of undergraduate and graduate research assistants working in the Center this summer, and we'll make it a point to take a little time out here and there for some socializing, like this pizza lunch that gave students a chance to get to know one another and to hear about what everyone is working on...

...and a typical day in the Center where almost all workspace are taken!

A big welcome to all the new research assistants, as well as the seasoned ones that have returned for more fun and excitement.

This project maps the opening and closing of 14,000 post offices in the U.S. West during the late nineteenth century. You can find the project here. (http://cameronblevins.org/gotp/) Academic Technology Specialist and Historian of the West Jason Heppler worked closely with Cameron to bring the project to its final form. Jason has written a thoughtful post (http://jasonheppler.org/2014/10/30/research-design-in-geography-of-the-post/) about the design process that went into this effort, and Cameron has written a piece (http://www.cameronblevins.org/posts/postal-geography-and-the-golden-west/) about how the visualization can be used in historical narrative. Congratulations, Cameron and Jason!

632073_cesta-monthly-newsletter.txt_5,PALLADIO 8.0,"CESTA's Humanities + Design (http://hdlab.stanford.edu/about/index.html) has released the latest version Palladio 8.0 this month! This release focuses on expanded Map View features. In response to your feedback, the Map View now handles different tile sets. Tile sets can be layered on top of one another and toggled as desired. This facilitates comparisons between historical and contemporary maps. In cases where a historical map only covers part of an area of interest, we can now see the rest of the area - either with a contemporary map, a different historical map, or a combination of the two. For more info about Palladio and the latest release note details, check out the H+D site (http://hdlab.stanford.edu/projects/palladio/) . Congrats!"
632073_cesta-monthly-newsletter.txt_6,IF A TREE FALLS IN THE FOREST...,"Interactive Visualization Shows Impact of Deforestation on the Last Large Remnant of Atlantic Rainforest in Brazil

The Iguaçu National Park was created by the Brazilian government between 1939 and 1944 on the border with Argentina, around the famous Iguazu Falls. With about 200,000 hectares, is one of the largest continuous areas remnants of the Atlantic rainforest that once covered most of Southeastern Brazil. The park is also home to the Iguazu Falls and is the most visited national park in the country, receiving more than 1.5 million tourists per year.

Frederico Freitas, (PhD candidate in Latin American history), Peter Salazar (History Senior), and Eli Berg (Chemistry/Computer Science Senior) created an interactive visualization (http://cesta.stanford.edu/projects/boundaries/) that shows the deforestation occurring in the vicinity of the park in the last 60 years. The contrast between the aerial photos of 1953, 1980 and today demonstrates the extent of deforestation in the region outside the park. From the 1950s on, thousands of settlers from other Brazilian states migrated into Western Paraná, where the park is located, which resulted in the destruction of most of the rainforest that until the mid-1950s covered the area.

The research led by Freitas reconstructs the last 60 years of the history of the park through two sets of aerial photographs produced in 1953 and 1980 by the government of the state of Paraná, in southern Brazil. The original films were found in the archives of the Institute of Geoscience and Cartography of Paraná, in Curitiba. They were then scanned in Brazil and georeferenced in California, at the CESTA Laboratory by Freitas, Salazar, and Berg.

Regeneration

The research also demonstrates how landscape change was redirected towards regeneration. The present-day forest cover inside the park is not pristine. A large area of what is forest now appears as cleared in the images of 1980. The creation of the park by the Brazilian federal government in 1939 was challenged by the State of Paraná, which encouraged settlers to move inside the park in the 1950s and 1960s. This resulted in a conflictive process of removal and resettlement of settlers from the park promoted by the Brazilian military dictatorship in the 1970s. After the eviction of the settlers, the forest regenerated itself in most of the territory previously occupied by farms.

632073_cesta-monthly-newsletter.txt_7,CESTA GOES TO SWEDEN,"Genres of Scholarly Knowledge Production

The Wallenberg Foundations have supported collaborative research at Stanford for well over a decade.  In this context, the Media Places initiative was launched under the auspices of the Wallenberg Research Network in 2011.  Media Places involves scholars from Umeå University (HUMlab) and Stanford University (CESTA , History Education, and Communication).  This winter marks the third major conference involving participants in the project and will include a range of scholars working in related fields from around the world.   CESTA-affiliated participants in the conference, to be held in Umeå from December 10-12, include Franco Moretti, Nicole Coleman, Brian Johnsrud, and Zephyr Frank.  The innovative conference space located in HUMlab’s facilities is shown below in a 3D rendering.  Now I have to figure out what goes on the floor display and whether or not to walk on it during my talk.

For more information on the Genres of Scholarly Knowledge Production conference, see their website (http://www.humlab.umu.se/sv/event/genres-of-scholarly-knowledge-production/) .

RYAN HEUSER
Hi, I’m Ryan Heuser, the Associate Research Director of CESTA's Literary Lab, as well as a Ph.D. student in English here at Stanford. In the Literary Lab, we conduct a number of computational research projects in literary history and theory. As programmers and researchers, I and my colleague Mark-Algee Hewitt—also Associate Research Director as well as Professor of Digital Humanities in English—act as engines for research, helping to drive forward both the technical and theoretical aspects of these projects, each of which involves a different set of graduate students, professors, and other researchers. Within CESTA, I act as resident text miner, helping and consulting researchers with various text-mining aspects of their own projects. In my Ph.D. work, I am interested in articulating a literary history of words of abstraction and ideology, such as “Virtue” and “Refinement”, as they evolve across the eighteenth century and diminish in the nineteenth. In the very small portion
of my life not dedicated to research, I am an avid news reader, an activist in social justice issues, and an inveterate techno dancer.

CELENA ALLEN
Hello! My name is Celena Allen and I am the GIS Specialist and Project Coordinator at CESTA. I work primarily with the Spatial History Project yet I love working with our larger CESTA community whenever the opportunities present themselves. Primarily, my focus and energy is on students and various projects assigned to our lab. When not navigating the waters of GIS, I enjoy connecting brilliant researchers with incredible students while fostering existing collaborative relationships. I am here to support students, researchers, and the research process; and because of the wide variety of projects we host at the Spatial History Project, no two days are ever the same for me! These are some of the reasons why I have so much fun working here at CESTA. In addition to the many interesting projects, I work with an amazing community filled with talented people.  Basically, I work in the best place ever.

When I’m not at CESTA I’m at home or exploring with my ridiculously cute daughter Miya and her partner in crime, daddy."
