** New Program Assistant, Amanda Wilson Bergado
------------------------------------------------------------
Amanda Wilson Bergado portrait CESTA is proud to announce the addition of Amanda Wilson Bergado, who joins us to assist with event planning, communications, and the Research Assistant program. A Monterey County native, Amanda attended UC San Diego where she double-majored in History and Political science, focusing on East Asia and International Relations. At graduate school at UC Santa Cruz, she specialized in late 19th and early 20th century U.S. history. Her research examined discourses of deviancy of Chinese migrants and criminality within Chinatowns during the era of Chinese Exclusion.

This will be Amanda’s second time working on Stanford’s campus. Prior to graduate school, she worked at the Freshman Dean's Office and Undergraduate Advising and Research (https://undergrad.stanford.edu/advising) . Amanda’s professional expertise largely centers on project management, event coordination, and communications. As a historian, she is trained in more traditional archival research, including utilizing immigration, municipal, court, and prison records as well as newspapers and genealogical sources. Even before joining CESTA, Amanda followed the news from some of CESTA's projects from afar, notably the Chinese Railroad Workers in North America project (https://cesta.stanford.edu/projects-labs/core-research-groups/chinese-railroad-workers-north-america) . “I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to work in a space that so aptly integrates my intellectual passions with my professional experience,” says Amanda.

Amanda is incredibly talented and kind. We couldn’t be more excited that she’s here.

** Looking Beyond Imagining San Francisco: What Urban History Looks Like in Practice
------------------------------------------------------------


** By Ocean Howell
------------------------------------------------------------
Imagined San Francisco is a website that allows visitors to understand why the City-by-the-Bay looks the way it does and how it might have looked differently. With a digital platform, one can not only include more images, but can also layer, manipulate, and analyze them. Imagined San Francisco (https://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/project.php?id=1141) traces the history of urban planning in San Francisco, placing special emphasis on unrealized plans. Rather than using visual material simply to illustrate outcomes, Imagined San Francisco uses historical maps, architectural renderings, and photographs to show what might have been. By enabling users to layer a series of urban plans, the project presents the city not only as a sequence of material changes, but also as a contingent process and a battleground for political power.
When I look at urban plans for San Francisco across the course of the twentieth century, I'm struck by how ambitious and dedicated the city's planners were. (Even though I think some of the specific proposals were terrible ideas!) Every time I hear a discussion about the nation's crumbling infrastructure, I can't help but think that we would do well to remember what we were able to accomplish when there was political will and a commitment to the public good.

In the course of my research, I’ve tracked down hundreds of historical urban plans—plans for transportation, housing, office space, industrial districts, public buildings, recreation space, and more. Most of these plans had multiple iterations, each slightly different than the other. For the sake of clarity when analyzing these iterations, I’d often have to select only one; otherwise, the site would become overwhelming and cluttered. That clarity does have a cost; tracking all of the small changes reveals a lot of texture, a lot of the nitty-gritty about how the planning process actually works. As comprehensive as Imagined San Francisco is, there’s a surprising amount that you don’t get to see.

Urban history is a field that relies on visual materials: maps, plans, photographs, architectural renderings, and more. Digital tools allow scholars to conduct more robust analysis of these materials, and they also offer more options for presenting research. Given the advantages in the cost of dissemination, and given the changing reading habits of the American public, digital platforms also hold out the promise of bringing scholarly research to a wider audience.

There are two types of sources that I would love to see digitized: fire insurance maps and city directories. The old Sanborn Fire Insurance maps (https://www.loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps/about-this-collection/) documented American cities, down to the level of individual structures, at roughly 10-year intervals from the late-nineteenth century into the 1950s. They give the researcher a very granular view of how a city changed over time. Unfortunately, they are cumbersome and difficult to use. Historical city directories link people, businesses, and institutions to specific addresses at yearly intervals. But like the Sanborn maps, they are difficult to work with. No matter how familiar you become with the source base, the going is always slow, and there's only so much you can hope to accomplish. However, if both of these source bases were digitized, we would be able to reproduce fine-grained social geographies by running simple queries. These tools would be even more
powerful when paired with the census data that has already been digitized. For Imagined San Francisco, these tools would allow me to show, with much greater precision, exactly who was going to be affected by specific plans; they might also provide some insight into why certain plans were floated to begin with. But the applications would extend far beyond my own project, and could revolutionize the field of urban history.


** Delivering the Digital Humanities: A Conversation with Rachel Midura
------------------------------------------------------------
Rachel Midure Portrait Here at Stanford University since 2014, Rachel Midura is a PhD Candidate in History working on her dissertation, "The Published Courier: The Culture of the Post, 1500-1700." At CESTA, Rachel is studying 16th century Milanese Post Master Ottavio Codogno’s postal itinerary. With the chance to ask Rachel a few questions, we wanted to know more about what it means to study a postal itinerary and how and why she does it within the digital humanities realm.

CESTA: Hi Rachel. So tell us, what exactly is a postal itinerary and why did you choose to focus on Ottavio Codogno’s?

Rachel Midura: In 1608, Milanese lieutenant postmaster Ottavio Codogno’s Nuovo itinerario delle poste per tutto il mondo first went to press. The postal itinerary exemplified a popular early modern genre that sought to familiarize users with the times, distances, costs, and customs of an increasingly pan-European postal network. The booklets—small enough to fit in one’s hand—also represent the adaptiveness and interactivity of seventeenth-century print materials. This project seeks to advance those traits to a new digital presentation. Just as travelers once planned the routes for their goods, letters, and increasingly, themselves, so too can the user of "Ottavio Codogno's Itinerary" plan virtual trips across Europe and the world.

CESTA: Wow, all that? It sounds like the most in-the-know travel guide ever.

RM: [Laughs] I guess you could say that.

CESTA: We’re curious, what are some of the interesting findings that have come up in your research—that won’t necessarily make it to the final project—that you’ve found most compelling?

RM: While the dissertation is still at its initial stages, I began reading postal itineraries as a part of a second-year seminar paper. I was familiar with the utility of DH visualization as a means of reading across dense reference texts, particularly from my work with the Grand Tour project. I designed a database that would help me parse the seventeenth-century “tabular data,” and reinterpret it with dynamic visualization. The greatest surprise was how naturally the information transferred from one form to the other, which brought home the effectiveness of the original text technology. Additionally, when I set up the initial comparison between the 1608 and 1623 editions, I expected to see the impact of the political and religious conflict of the Thirty Years’ War as new obstacles and more sharply defined borders. Instead, I found preliminary evidence for the opposite—war fostered newer, longer communication networks. This has impacted my transnational, cultural approach to
a topic usually treated in the context of increasing European divisiveness.

CESTA: It’s amazing to see the way visualization changes how we see things. What are some of the most vital tools that you use?

RM: The database was built from my experience working with tabular data and Palladio (http://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/) , while I used my new knowledge of some R programming language to build the Shiny website (https://rmidura.shinyapps.io/Codogno/) . Moving forward, I hope to gain inspiration and feedback from spatial historians and cartographers as I experiment with “distorted” maps to represent more accurately the early modern experience of the post.

CESTA: What is the biggest challenge facing you right now?

RM: The biggest challenge stems from the same place as my commitment to the digital humanities. I am dedicated to the digital curation, annotation, and visualization of the vast resources resulting from worldwide digitization efforts. Historians and humanists more widely have the training to separate the good data from the bad, and at the same time, we stand to benefit the most from new horizons of research. However, it remains difficult to balance a traditional career path with these new opportunities, and so I am always thinking about ways to better integrate the world of the digital humanities with that of the traditional academe.

CESTA: We promised to keep it quick, Rachel, thank you for your time.

RM: It’s been a pleasure.

Rachel will be headed to Washington D.C. in July to take part in the Early Modern Digital Agendas (http://folgerpedia.folger.edu/EMDA_2017) session led by CESTA alumna Ruth Ahnert and Jonathan Hope.


** Mapping Old Regimes of Movement
------------------------------------------------------------


** By Luca Scholz
------------------------------------------------------------

Luca Scholtz portrait
Calls to restrict human migration, to regulate the circulation of capital, or to promote the free trade of some goods while banning that of others shape political agendas around the globe. The ordering of movement has become one of the most controversial issues of our day. From the migration of refugees to calls for trade restrictions and capital controls, we are witnessing fundamental changes in the way our societies administer rights of passage.

The regimes of movement that connect and fracture our societies have a history. My spatial history project at CESTA, "Mapping Old Regimes of Movement," tries to visualize the spatial history of sovereignty and human mobility within and beyond old-regime Europe. Control over the movement of goods and persons—from the Spanish treasure fleet to the English poor laws—was a key concern for old-regime societies. In the complex array of ill-defined, overlapping political entities that characterized the pre-modern world, neighboring authorities, local communities, and transient populations frequently competed with each other. Through maps and other visualizations, the project shows that flows of goods and people often shaped early modern states more than these states could shape these flows themselves.

My project relies heavily on digital mapping tools and GIS in particular. We use QGIS to georeference and digitize older maps and merge contemporary data with data compiled from edited and archival sources. Our aim is to understand space not in absolute terms, but rather to take into account the experience of mobile populations and their real potential for using space at different times and under different conditions. Currently, the biggest challenge we are facing is to devise more creative ways of visualizing patterns of mobility in space. Until now, we have mostly relied on GIS, which is limited by its simplistic conception of space and favors a quantitative approach. In the coming years, I intend to develop a broader range of visualization techniques that are more amenable to qualitative analysis.

In all this, the research assistants who joined my project through CESTA’s RA program (https://cesta.stanford.edu/programs/undergraduate-programs) were of invaluable help. Not only did they help with the various tasks a project like this involves (such as data curation, georeferencing, and digitizing), but they also made important intellectual contributions, noting spatial patterns that would have gone unnoticed or bringing in their technical expertise, such as when Madison used her skills in R to determine the ideal class intervals for one of our visualizations.

A project like this would be impossible without the use of GIS, and, indeed, digital tools have become a key element of many research projects in history. Though most historians make at least some use of digital tools, and be it only a reference management software, many scholars remain skeptical towards using more digital tools in their research. I believe that at this point, the most important challenge for digital humanists is asking meaningful research questions and showing that digital tools can help to provide adequate answers to those questions. Indeed, digital humanities research is at its best when it manages to marry relevance and technical innovation. At a time in which digital tools affect virtually every aspect of our lives, those scholars who meet this challenge intelligently will form the spearhead of their disciplines.


** The Quarter in Review
------------------------------------------------------------
Here at CESTA, we take time at the end of each quarter to look back on the events we’ve hosted and the work we’ve done. The end of the quarter is both a time to reflect and a time to plan for the future. In that vein, here is a bright and brief look back on CESTA events, including the CESTA Seminars Series. From Greece to London, from South Africa to America, this quarter’s programs focused on issues of race, space, and how digital renderings further our understanding of the world and its history. Also, refer to the webpages of core research groups and affiliated faculty projects, such as DH Asia (http://dhasia.org/2016/10/dhasia-stanford-2017-schedule/) and theSpatial History Project Working Group (http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/page.php?id=1) , to review additional programs offered this past spring.
