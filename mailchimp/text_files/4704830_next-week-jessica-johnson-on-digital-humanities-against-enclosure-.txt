Bridging past and present in digital practice is more important now than ever. In "Digital Humanities Against Enclosure," Jessica Johnson, Assistant Professor of History at John Hopkins University, will explore the paradigms and possibilities for digital practice in our research, teaching, and collaborative work that moves beyond project completion and embodies a crossroads praxis: A praxis of engagement with our machines that centers history, ethics of care, active accountability, and our humanity.

Chair: Giovanna Ceserani, Faculty Director at CESTA
UCL Respondent: Nenna Orie Chuku
Stanford Respondent: Anna Toledano
