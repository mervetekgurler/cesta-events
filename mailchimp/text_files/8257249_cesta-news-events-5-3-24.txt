Jordan Crouser
How Can We Best Use Visuals and Visualizations in our Teaching? (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/how-can-we-best-use-visuals-and-visualizations-our-teaching)

Thursday, May 9th | 3:00 - 4:20 PM | Wallenberg Hall 433a

As a data scientist specializing in visual analytics, Professor Crouser is particularly attuned to how visualizations can help (or hinder) student learning. Join us for a 90-minute presentation and discussion on how to use visuals and data storytelling best in the undergraduate classroom. RSVP to the workshop here (https://forms.gle/ZoHXvXD79216Meag6) .

This event is co-sponsored by the Ptarmigan Fund for Late Ancient Studies and CESTA.

Jordan Crouser is a visual analytics researcher and semi-professional data wrangler. He is passionate about learning, and his teaching philosophy is grounded in three simple principles: each learner builds and rebuilds her own body of knowledge; people build the things they care about; and people keep building when they can see that they’re making progress. In the classroom and in his research, he encourages students to challenge their working models of the world in service of problems that matter to them.

His research program investigates the complementary nature of human and machine computation as used in visual analytics and other human-machine collaborative systems. These systems make use of the human visual system, as well as our capacity to understand and reason about complex data. He has published his technical contributions in the areas of visualization theory (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327292/?arnumber=6327292&tag=1) , human-computer interaction (http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00779-011-0404-2) , educational technology (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1518851) , visual analytics systems (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6051409/?arnumber=6051409&tag=1)  and human computation (https://www.smith.edu/sites/default/files/media/Faculty/crouser_humancomputation.pdf) . Prior to returning to academia, Crouser spent two years doing research and building analytical tools at MIT Lincoln Laboratory (https://www.ll.mit.edu/) .

Crouser earned his master's in educational technology and doctorate in computer science in 2013 from the VALT: Visual Analytics Laboratory at Tufts University and is also a proud member of the Smith College class of 2008. In his spare time, he enjoys board games, cooking and bicycling.

** The 2024 Stanford Caribbean Studies Symposium with Professor Usha Iyer (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/2024-stanford-caribbean-studies-symposium-professor-usha-iyer)
------------------------------------------------------------

Friday, May 10 | 5:00-7:00 PM | Wallenberg Hall 433a

The 2024 Stanford Caribbean Studies Symposium features a talk by Stanford faculty member, Professor Usha Iyer (Film and Media Studies) who will present from their book project, Jammin’: Black and Brown Media Intimacies between India and the Caribbean. Through analyses of film, music, and social media, this talk will discuss the intimacies and frictions that have developed around the legacies of African enslavement and Indian indentureship in Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, and Guyana. Dr. Iyer is the Faculty Coordinator of the CCSRE Research Network, Black and Brown Intimacies across Africa, South Asia, and the Caribbean.

RSVP required. RSVP here (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5PayG2lsDW9qcqO8pcd0ZvPFKvI4DBb7EwsGU1YkqDXv5vQ/viewform) . Zoom information available for RSVPs. Food and wine will be provided to the in person attendees.

Usha Iyer is an Assistant Professor in the Art and Art History Department at Stanford University. Their research and teaching interests lie at the intersection of cinema, performance, and gender and sexuality studies, with a specific focus on Global South cultural traffic along the vectors of race, gender, caste, and religion. Iyer (she/they) is the author of Dancing Women: Choreographing Corporeal Histories of Hindi Cinema (https://global.oup.com/academic/product/dancing-women-9780190938741?cc=us〈=en&)  (Oxford University Press, 2020), which examines constructions of gender, stardom, sexuality, and spectacle in Hindi cinema through women’s labor, collaborative networks, and gestural genealogies to produce a corporeal history of South Asian cultural modernities. Iyer’s current book project, Jammin’: Black and Brown Media Intimacies between India and the Caribbean (under contract with Columbia University Press), studies the deep affective engagement of Caribbean spectators with Indian cinema
in relation to discourses of belonging and citizenship that have developed around the histories of African enslavement and Indian indentureship in Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, and Guyana. The book equally attends to the impact of Caribbean cultural forms on Indian film industries, which, through pirate and informal networks appropriated and adapted soca, chutney, and other musical and performance forms that were products of a creole modernity.  Iyer is co-editing with Manishita Dass the volume, Shift Focus: Reframing the Indian New Waves (under contract with Oxford University Press). This anthology brings together a diverse group of scholars to examine the unexplored cultural, political, and aesthetic genealogies, impulses, and resonances of the Indian New Waves. Iyer is the Annenberg Faculty Fellow, School of the Humanities and Sciences (2022-2024), and serves as affiliate faculty in Stanford's Center for South Asia, the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CCSRE), and
in the Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (FGSS) program. Their research has been supported by fellowships from The George A. and Eliza Gardner Howard Foundation, Stanford Humanities Center, Clayman Institute of Gender Research, CCSRE, FGSS, and Stanford Global Studies.

Mellon Sawyer Seminar


** Ayesha K. Hardison:
Recuperating Forgotten Narratives   (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/mellon-sawyer-seminar-series-recuperating-forgotten-narratives-part-2-ayesha-hardison)
------------------------------------------------------------

Thursday, May 16 | 5:30-7:00 PM | Wallenberg Hall 433a

Previous seminars in our series have attended to divisions, but also possibilities, engendered by data along various fault lines and contexts (from 19th-century statistical thinking to biases in archives, from the challenges of quantification to the history of data governance). With this seminar on ‘Recuperating Forgotten Narratives’ we focus on what happens to text when it is digitized and turned into data. What new possibilities open up with this type of textual data? What new narratives can be written about past and present textual traditions? What remains irretrievable?

This is the eighth event in the Mellon Sawyer Seminar series, The Data that Divides Us: Recalibrating Data Methods for New Knowledge Frameworks Across the Humanities, generously funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. During Stanford University's 2023-24 academic year, the Sawyer Seminar Series has convened scholars from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and personal standpoints to discuss the data that has saturated our world.

Professor Ayesha Hardison will talk about the work of digitizing and making accessible the history of Black writing, as texts and recordings are collected, curated and transformed from an archival project to data and digital texts, sounds and visuals. Following the talk, there will be a response by Chloé Brault (PhD candidate in Comparative Literature at Stanford).

We will have a reception before the talk, starting at 5 pm. If you cannot join us in person, you can request a Zoom link through this link (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJctdu6urTIvH9VJMG0-mawZmG7s4mzTZRXm#/registration) .

Ayesha K. Hardison is Associate Professor of English and Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at the University of Kansas. Her research and teaching explore questions of race, gender, genre, social politics, and historical memory. She is the author of Writing through Jane Crow: Race and Gender Politics in African American Literature (University of Virginia Press, 2014), is co-editor with Eve Dunbar of African American Literature in Transition: 1930–1940 (Cambridge University Press, 2022), and has published several book chapters as well as articles in African American Review and Meridians. Hardison has received fellowships and awards from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Schomburg Center Scholars-In-Residence Program, Black Metropolis Research Consortium, National Humanities Center Summer Residency Program, Humanities Kansas, and the Ford Foundation. She is director of the History of Black Writing (HBW) and co-editor of the multidisciplinary journal Women, Gender, and Families of
Color.  She also works on the Mellon funded project Stories for All: A Digital Storytelling Project for the Twenty-First Century (https://storiesforall.org/story/history-of-black-writing/) and co-directs Project on the History of Black Writing (https://hurston.ku.edu (https://hurston.ku.edu/) ).
