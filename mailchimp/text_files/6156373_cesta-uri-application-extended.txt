Applications for CESTA's Undergraduate Research Internship have been extended to November 30th! Visit the CESTA webpage to learn more and apply today (https://cesta.stanford.edu/students/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-research-internship-program) !

The Undergraduate Research Internship (https://cesta.stanford.edu/students/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-research-internship-program) program empowers students to apply technologies across the Humanities and Social Sciences in ways that enhance our understanding of the world. Applications for the 2023-24 program (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddXA1_Ej0n8nOZCyObxbO5TrKgvbQX96yQ1GpSR49eVzwoNw/formrestricted)  have been extended to November 30, 2023.

CESTA cultivates research at the intersection of computing, design, and the humanities. The Center utilizes digital and computational methods to investigate cultural records, objects, and historical phenomena through space and time. CESTA projects explore the history of technologies, preserve and explain the written and artistic records of peoples across the world, and bring new life to the stories of individuals who helped build America.

The Undergraduate Research Internship provides opportunities for undergraduates to work on these projects throughout the academic year. Through structured research training, experimentation with cutting-edge technologies, and faculty mentorship, students develop valuable academic and professional skill sets. Work on lab projects allows students to apply their developing expertise in data science, GIS, and web development in tandem with humanities skills in critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and ethical decision-making.

You can read about the experiences of recent interns in CESTA's 2022 Research Anthology (https://issuu.com/stanfordhumanities/docs/cesta_anthology_2022?fr=sN2Q0YzU2NDAzMTA) .

CESTA News & Announcements

Face/Interface: Global Type Design and Human-Computer Interaction (https://www.eventbrite.com/e/faceinterface-global-type-design-and-human-computer-interaction-tickets-720692238887)

40 years ago, Turing Award winning computer scientist Donald Knuth teamed up with MacArthur Fellow type designer Chuck Bigelow to convene “The Computer and the Hand in Type Design,” an ATypI-sponsored conference that formed part of one the world’s earliest digital typography graduate programs.

In recognition of this momentous anniversary in both Stanford and design history, and building upon the success of the 2017 Face/Interface gathering, we are delighted to announce a second international conference bringing together scholars, designers, engineers, and technologists to explore global type design, book design, interface design, and human-computer interaction.

Organized by SILICON (https://silicon.stanford.edu/)  in partnership with Atelier national de recherche typographique/ENSAD Nancy

Part of Stanford Global Studies’ Global Research Workshop Program
