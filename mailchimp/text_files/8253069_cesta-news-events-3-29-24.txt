Haifeng Hu: Topic modeling and BookNLP: Seeking the emotional turn in the history of eighteenth-century English fiction (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/topic-modeling-and-booknlp-seeking-emotional-turn-history-eighteenth-century-english-fiction)

Tuesday, April 2 | 12-1:15 PM | Wallenberg Hall 433A

While topic modeling has been widely used in NLP tasks, its application to literary texts has encountered challenges and dilemmas. In this seminar, I will begin by conducting topic modeling on a single novel, Robinson Crusoe, as a case study to demonstrate how we can use topic modeling for fiction analysis with the help of word2vec to differentiate different topic words in space, which makes it easier to interpret their significances. The result is further validated by readings of different editions of the novel through topic modeling. In the next step, I will apply topic modeling to the history of eighteenth-century English fiction, where I have found an interesting phenomenon of the topic of 'cry'. Following this clue, I have studied the evolution of emotional expression in English novels in the 18th century. By using BookNLP, I extract the usage of nouns and verbs related to emotions and feelings over the course of time, and explore how this trend is influenced by gender. The digital
evidence amassed in this research contributes to understanding issues concerning the emergence of sentimentalism and emotions in literary works.

Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series:
Recuperating Forgotten Narratives
Monday, April 8 | 5:30 - 7:00 PM | Wallenberg Hall 433A

Previous seminars in our series have attended to divisions, but also possibilities, engendered by data along various fault lines and contexts (from 19th-century statistical thinking to biases in archives, from the challenges of quantification to the history of data governance). With this seminar on ‘Recuperating Forgotten Narratives’ we focus on what happens to text when it is digitized and turned into data. What new possibilities open up with this type of textual data? What new narratives can be written about past and present textual traditions? What remains irretrievable?

This is the fifth event in the Mellon Sawyer Seminar series, The Data that Divides Us: Recalibrating Data Methods for New Knowledge Frameworks Across the Humanities, generously funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. During Stanford University's 2023-24 academic year, the Sawyer Seminar Series will convene scholars from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and personal standpoints to discuss the data that has saturated our world. Professor Marlene Daut will talk about how digitizing and making accessible early 19th-century Haitian print culture can act as a kind of counter-exhibit, both to actual exhibits and in general to the way that Haiti is portrayed across various types of media. Following the talk, there will be a response by Matt Randolph (PhD candidate in History at Stanford).

There will be a reception at 5 pm prior to the talk. If you cannot attend in person, you can register for a Zoom link here (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0qdOuqpzsuHd00tRhtbdI-c7vHjdIvaIAP#/registration) .
Marlene L. Daut is Professor of French and African American Studies at Yale University. Her books include Tropics of Haiti: Race and the Literary History of the Haitian Revolution in the Atlantic World; Baron de Vastey and the Origins of Black Atlantic Humanism; and Awakening the Ashes: An Intellectual History of the Haitian Revolution. Her articles on Haitian history and culture have appeared in The New Yorker, The New York Times, Harper’s Bazaar, Essence, The Nation, and the LA Review of Books. She has won several awards, grants, and fellowships for her contributions to historical and cultural understandings of the Caribbean, notably from the Ford Foundation, the American Council of Learned Societies, the Haitian Studies Association, and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series:  Catastrophe, Data and Transformation (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/mellon-sawyer-seminar-series-catastrophe-data-and-transformation-dagomar-degroot-and-jessica)
Thursday, April 11 | 5:30 - 7:00 PM | Wallenberg Hall 433A

Historically, catastrophes and disaster occasioned early efforts at social data collection. With these data before them, early modern authorities considered how best to respond to disaster and ward off recurrence. Meanwhile, modern catastrophes have inspired examinations of premodern data with an eye to understanding the deep patterns of the longue durée, with hopes of yielding not only a better understanding of the past, but also actionable data relevant to our contemporary crises.

This workshop interrogates the historical relationship between disaster and data. How have catastrophe and data collection have fed into and conditioned historical transformation? How did the accumulation of biopower develop in the early modern world? What patterns and practices of catastrophe and transformation can human and non-human data illuminate?

Dagomar Degroot and Jessica Otis examine early modern catastrophe through a variety of data sources, from early modern human data through physical and biological data which evidence past disasters. Please join us for a conversation about catastrophe, data, and transformation.

There will be a reception at 5 pm prior to the event. If you cannot attend in person, you can register for a Zoom link here (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0ucuyrqzovHtbS6DmuGa5QXWsHjlJjjslb#/registration) .


Jessica Otis is Assistant Professor of History and Director of Public Projects at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. Her book By the Numbers: Numeracy, Religion, and the Quantitative Transformation of Early Modern England (Oxford University Press, 2024) explores how changing technologies of knowledge impacted how early modern people understood and interacted with the world around them. Her NSF-funded Death by Numbers project (deathbynumbers.org (http://deathbynumbers.org/) ) is transcribing, publishing, and quantitatively analyzing the London Bills of Mortality in order to investigate how lived experiences of plague outbreaks intersected with an emerging quantitative mentality among the people of early modern England. She is also one of the Project Directors of the NEH-funded Mathematical Humanists Institute for Advanced Topics in Digital Humanities, which is offering a series of workshops on the mathematics that underpins common DH methods.
Dagomar Degroot is an associate professor of environmental history at Georgetown University. His first book, The Frigid Golden Age, was published by Cambridge University Press in 2018 and named by the Financial Times as one of the ten best history books of that year. His forthcoming book, Ripples on the Cosmic Ocean, is under contract with Harvard University Press and Viking, and he is editing several books on past climate change - including the Oxford Handbook of Resilience in Climate History. Degroot publishes equally in historical and scientific journals, including Nature and the American Historical Review, and writes for a popular audience in, for example, the Washington Post, Aeon Magazine, and The Conversation. He maintains popular online resources on the history of climate change, and has shared the unique perspectives of the past with policymakers, corporate leaders, and journalists in many cities, from Wuhan to Washington, DC.

Global Horizons of Digital and Public Humanities: "Cities and Water"

CESTA will be hosting a group of scholars, students, and professors from the Venice Centre for Digital and Public Humanities (VeDPH) (https://www.unive.it/pag/39287) , a part of the Department of Humanities of Ca' Foscari University of Venice, with the support of Stanford Humanities Center, under the umbrella of "Global Horizons for Digital and Public Humanities" programming. The scholars will be visiting Stanford between April 22^nd and April 26th. During that week, we will host paper sessions, roundtables, and workshops on recent and global research, approaches, and tools in digital and public humanities. Some of these sessions are also open to public. Please be on the lookout for the schedule, which will come out in the next couple of weeks. If you are a Stanford affiliate and interested in being part of this program, please email eeyurek@stanford.edu.

Wednesday, April 24 | 4:00 - 7:00 PM | Fry Gunn Rotunda, Neurosciences Building

Join us for a co-hosted lecture on "Data Feminism for AI" with Professor Lauren Klein (Departments of English and Quantitative Theory and Methods at Emory University).  The talk will be centered around on how principles around Data Feminism can be applied to conversations around AI in our current technological landscape. The lecture will be followed up by a panel featuring Professors Adrian Daub and Chiara Sabatti of Stanford University. The talk will be followed up by a reception. RSVP is necessary for entry.

In Data Feminism (MIT Press, 2020), Klein and her coauthor Catherine D'Ignazio established a set of principles for doing more just and equitable data science. Informed by the past several decades of intersectional feminist activism and critical thought, the principles of data feminism modeled how to examine and challenge power, rethink binaries and hierarchies, elevate emotion and embodiment, consider context, embrace pluralism, and make labor visible. How can these principles be applied to the current conversation about AI, its present harms, and its future possibilities? This talk will briefly summarize the principles of data feminism before moving to a set of examples that show how these principles can be applied–and extended–in our current technological landscape.

This talk is co-hosted by the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) (https://cesta.stanford.edu/)  and Stanford Data Science. It is co-sponsored by Stanford University Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) (https://hai.stanford.edu/) , The Clayman Institute for Gender Research (https://gender.stanford.edu/)  and theStanford Humanities Center.  (https://shc.stanford.edu/)

Stanford Research Computing Fellowship (https://srcc.stanford.edu/)

Stanford Research Computing (SRC (https://srcc.stanford.edu/) ) invites graduate students in the Humanities and Social Sciences to apply for a Summer Quarter fellowship to develop original digital research in our high-performance computing environment.

While the aim will be a professional-quality research project, we recognize that many students in these disciplines do not have experience doing digital research. Therefore, the internship will provide hands-on support from SRC’s Research Data Facilitator and the rest of the support staff as needed.

The fellowship will be awarded based on a project proposal, but we welcome projects at all stages of ideation and planning, and applicants of all experience and degree levels. We are especially interested in funding projects from early career scholars, master’s students, and individuals from underrepresented backgrounds. While some general coding experience is desired, Stanford Research Computing is prepared to offer project support in a broad range of areas.

There are three fellowships available, with the awardees forming a learning cohort. Each fellowship comes with a $5,000 stipend, as well as office space in Polya Hall. The recipients will be expected to give a final presentation on their project at the end of the quarter.

Those interested should complete the form  (https://forms.gle/FsTEi6gFvZAmvvac9) here (https://forms.gle/FsTEi6gFvZAmvvac9)  by April 23. Please direct questions to bcritt@stanford.edu (mailto:bcritt@stanford.edu) . The winner will be announced May 1
Call for Abstracts (https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/page/cultures-of-scale-disciplines-data-and-labor)


** Cultures of Scale: Disciplines, Data, and Labor (https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/page/cultures-of-scale-disciplines-data-and-labor)
------------------------------------------------------------

The Debates in Digital Humanities Series seeks accounts of how DH and CH communities have reconfigured their modes of knowledge production in the recent or distant past to accommodate the challenges and affordances of scale and to convey their collective histories and values to other audiences. Mapping the frameworks and debates already established and embedded within the digital humanities and cultural heritage is a vital step towards moving beyond the norms being imposed by Big Tech. Pushing back against our present moment’s zeal for scale is less an evasive maneuver than an opportunity to imagine new kinds of exchange between frequently disparate disciplines, a process for finding new paths within and beyond the current realities of our besieged and imperfect institutions, especially those that preserve and activate cultural heritage. Cross-cutting and comparative approaches to scale, we hold, may even help us envision new, multidisciplinary modes for digital humanities teaching,
stewardship, and scholarship capable of providing for free, just, and joyful futures.
