Next Week at CESTA

Lunch & Learn: The CESTA DH Fellows Program (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/lunch-and-learn-cesta-dh-fellows-program)

Tuesday, October 17 | 12:00-1:15 PM | Wallenberg Hall, 4th Floor

CESTA's Digital Humanities Fellows Program (https://cesta.stanford.edu/graduate-programs/digital-humanities-fellows-program)  is designed to prepare graduate students for a future where digital scholarship is the norm. This year the program is tailored to advanced graduate students (ABD) and recent PhDs with digital projects that would benefit from integration into a community of scholars and practitioners, participation in curated workshops, and, perhaps most importantly, receive two quarters (up to 150 hours) of dedicated support from an undergraduate research intern.

In advance of the upcoming application deadline (October 31), prospective applicants are encouraged to attend this workshop to learn more about the application process, expectations, and benefits of the DH Fellows Program. Participants will have an opportunity to meet and pose questions to  program director Will Fenton (https://profiles.stanford.edu/william-fenton)  and past program director, Nicole Coleman (https://profiles.stanford.edu/nicole-coleman) ; hear from recent fellows about their experience working with undergraduate research interns; and learn more about CESTA's support for graduate students.

This workshop will include lunch and take place at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis in Wallenberg 433A. A Zoom link is available upon request from Office Management Intern, Daniela Perez (perezd20@stanford.edu (mailto:perezd20@stanford.edu) ).

CESTA News & Announcements
Applications Now Open: The Digital Humanities Fellows Program (https://cesta.stanford.edu/graduate-programs/digital-humanities-fellows-program)

Over two quarters (Winter and Spring), fellows will enter a community of practice that features workshops with special guests tailored to the needs of the cohort, works-in-progress presentations from fellows, and guidance from scholars and practitioners across campus. Each DH Fellow will benefit from two quarters of support from an undergraduate research intern whose interests and expertise closely align with the research project.

To foster a community of practice, fellows gather for weekly meetings with their cohort. The program of meetings typically includes:
* Skills workshops
* Seminars from DH practitioners
* Works-in-progress presentations
* Graduate reading group

Learn about last year's cohort (https://cesta.stanford.edu/people/dh-fellows)  or see the full list of fellows' projects (https://cesta.stanford.edu/graduate-programs/alumni) .
Applications Now Open: (https://cesta.stanford.edu/students/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-research-internship-program) Undergraduate Research Internship Program (https://cesta.stanford.edu/students/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-research-internship-program)

The Undergraduate Research Internship (https://cesta.stanford.edu/students/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-research-internship-program) program empowers students to apply technologies across the Humanities and Social Sciences in ways that enhance our understanding of the world. Applications for the 2023-24 program are due November 22, 2023.

The Undergraduate Research Internship provides opportunities for undergraduates to work on CESTA research projects throughout the academic year. Through structured research training, experimentation with cutting-edge technologies, and faculty mentorship, students develop valuable academic and professional skill sets. Work on lab projects allows students to apply their developing expertise in data science, GIS, and web development in tandem with humanities skills in critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and ethical decision-making.

You can read about the experiences of recent interns in CESTA's 2022 Research Anthology (https://issuu.com/stanfordhumanities/docs/cesta_anthology_2022?fr=sN2Q0YzU2NDAzMTA) .

The Humanities Research Intensive (https://humanexperience.stanford.edu/undergraduates/humanities-research-intensive)

This seven-day course, taught over spring break, introduces freshmen and sophomores to the excitement of humanities research. It will prepare you to develop an independent summer research project, to work as a research assistant for a Stanford professor, or to apply for undergraduate research grants. Your laboratories will be the archives and museum collections at Stanford, where you’ll work closely with Professors Usha Iyer (Film and Media Studies), John Kieschnick (Religious Studies), Emanuele Lugli (Art and Art History), and Rose Salseda (Art and art History), doing hands-on research on ancient and modern books, manuscripts, images, and maps. Students who complete this course become Humanities Research Intensive Fellows and are eligible to apply for special HRI grants (https://humanexperience.stanford.edu/undergraduateshumanities-research-intensive/hri-fellowships)  to support follow-up research during the summer or following academic year.

Application Deadline: Sunday, November 5, 11:59 pm.
