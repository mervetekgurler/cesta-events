"Could a Robot Feel Pain? Race, Technology, and the Political Problem of Personhood"

Tue, Apr 5 | 4:00
–6:00PM PT | Levinthal Hall and Online

In this lecture, Sylvester A. Johnson interprets the work of Ibn Rushd ("Averroës"), the twelfth-century Islamic scholar of Andalusia who achieved renown as the "father" of secularism, in order to elucidate and heuristically challenge Ibn Rushd’s theory of the intellect as a power of the soul. Johnson leverages Rushd’s distinction between sensing and knowing in order to examine contemporary, sensory-driven AI technology (particularly brain-computer-interface architectures) as a uniquely generative problem of interest for humanists and technical experts alike. Of central importance is the sensation of pain, as it constitutes a phenomenon of embodiment, a category of human experience, and a political problem that has been implicated in histories of racial domination.

Johnson is Assistant Vice Provost for the Humanities and Executive Director of the "Tech for Humanity" initiative at Virginia Tech. For more on his views about Technology Innovation and AI Ethics, click here. >> (https://publications.arl.org/18nm1dd/)
