Mapping Sacred Spaces in Medieval Southern Italy  (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/elisabetta-scirocco-mapping-sacred-spaces-medieval-southern-italy)

Tuesday, May 16 | 12:00 -1:15 | Wallenberg 433A

In medieval churches, liturgical monumental installations were fundamental for both the setting and practice of the sacred. Where they have been dismantled, destroyed, or heavily transformed, the understanding of a medieval sacred space is possible only through reconstructive projects that require multidisciplinary research and collaborative endeavors.

This talk will address these challenges through the experience of the project Mapping Sacred Spaces. Forms, Functions, and Aesthetics in Medieval Southern Italy (11th-14th c.), dedicated to a still understudied Mediterranean region where religious, artistic, and technical encounters found one of their main expressions inside sacred spaces. The variety, complexity, and fragmentariness of the materials preserved in this vast territory can be fruitfully addressed combining different scales of analysis and mapping methodologies.

This event is sponsored and organized by the SGS Global Approaches to Sacred Space (https://globalsacredspace.su.domains/) . The Department of Religious Studies (https://religiousstudies.stanford.edu/) has also cosponsored the event.

The presentation will include lunch and take place at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis in Wallenberg 433A. A Zoom link is available upon request from Center Manager, Jonathan Clark (jclark93@stanford.edu (mailto:jclark93@stanford.edu) ).
