"The Business of Debt: A Digital Investigation of Municipal Bonds and Inequality"
Online, via Zoom. Register here (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUoc-6vqTMpGt0s-en5DdmnuADQPyCydI19) .

About this talk: The Business of Debt offers a visual analysis of the changing scope of the municipal bond business from the early moments of the Great Depression to the 1980s, a decade described by city officials, bankers, and others as one of tremendous chaos. By data visualization methods, the project moves from one period of precarity to another, documenting, in the years between, the remarkable growth of a tight-knit profession of bankers and bond attorneys. Ultimately, it helps users see that the bond market was made not through supply and demand or other autonomous forces, but by a relatively small group of identifiable people who bought, sold, held, and resold debt, and who helped turn cities into tax-exempt investment vehicles.

Destin Jenkins is a scholar of racial inequality. His work bridges the fields of economic, urban, and political history, and focuses on capitalism, democracy, and social movements in the United States during the long twentieth century. He is the author of The Bonds of Inequality: Debt and the Making of the American City (University of Chicago Press, 2021) and co-editor of Histories of Racial Capitalism (Columbia University Press, 2021). His writings have appeared in the Washington Post, The Nation, and the New York Times.

"Navigating the Faculty Job Market with DH" is now online!
For the inaugural event in our DH Careers Series, we brought together four assistant professors who work with DH methods to talk about the faculty job market and their own experiences applying for positions. Thank you to our panellists, Georgia Henley, Alexander Manshel, Rachel Midura, and Sarah Murray for their honest and thoughtful responses!

P.S. If you're a graduate student considering applying for the Digital Humanities Graduate Fellowship, you might be interested to know that three of our four panellists are previous program affiliates (and that it got several mentions during the event)!
