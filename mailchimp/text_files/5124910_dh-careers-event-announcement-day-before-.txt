Are you a graduate student looking for a career in the digital humanities, but feeling unsure about how to proceed?

This panel showcases four graduates from humanities PhD programs who are now pursuing DH careers beyond the tenure track. They have generously agreed to share reflections on their professional trajectories to date, the day-to-day of their current work, and what graduate students hoping to follow in their footsteps need to know.

Following a one-hour panel, attendees will have the opportunity to join the panelists in break-out rooms for an informal Q&A. This event is primarily intended for graduate students and early career researchers but is open to anyone who registers, regardless of institutional affiliation or career stage.

Our panelists are:

Ashley Champagne
Head of Digital Scholarship Project Planning, Brown University Library
PhD in English, University of California Santa Barbara

Will Fenton
Program Officer, Office of Challenge Programs, National Endowment for the Humanities
PhD in English, Fordham University

Emily McGinn
Humanities Computing Curriculum Specialist, Center for Digital Humanities, Princeton University
PhD in Comparative Literature, University of Oregon

Katie McDonough
Senior Research Associate, The Alan Turing Institute
PhD in History, Stanford University
DH Careers is a quarterly panel series showcasing the many professional paths for graduates with training in the digital humanities. You can watch our previous panel here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAw1vpXPU9A) . Our next panel, later this spring, will be on â€œDH Careers Beyond Academia".
