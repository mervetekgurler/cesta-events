Happening this week:
CESTA Seminar Series

“Digital Rasanblaj: Disassembling the Haitian Archive”
Prof. Marlene Daut, University of Virginia
Tuesday, January 12 at 12 pm
Register for the Zoom webinar (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAvd--rrTkjGtbFLRVVDz_8BYeU2iRthrME)

Interrogating approaches to the archives of Haiti, whose history is a critical but often forgotten part of the story of the making of the modern world-system, this talk asks the fundamental question:

What does it mean to engage in digital archiving not for the purposes of constituting historical authority, but for the purposes of community story-telling?

CESTA Co-Learning/Co-Working Group on Python (AKA Danger Noodle Club)
Participate via Zoom (https://stanford.zoom.us/j/91861765108?pwd=MTB1ZUZTS042WDVuVHRhYW9CQThTZz09)


Is learning to use Python for DH on your list of New Year’s resolutions? Join the CESTA co-learning/co-working Python group (AKA Danger Noodle Club)! We’ll be having our first meeting on Friday, January 15 from 2-4 PM Pacific to get a sense of where people are at, and what they’re interested in focusing on. From there, we’ll come up with a plan for the quarter.
If you’re interested in Python for DH -- even if you’ve never tried it or worked with code before -- come join a friendly group of Python learners at all levels! We’ll try to answer each other’s questions, troubleshoot problems, and provide moral support while Googling for solutions together!  If you can’t make it to the first meeting, you can join our mailing list (https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/danger-noodle) .
