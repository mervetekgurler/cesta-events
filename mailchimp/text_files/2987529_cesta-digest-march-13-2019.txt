Book Donations for the Museu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro

On the night of Sept. 2nd, the Museu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was lost to a devastating fire. Besides the invaluable collection, the museum housed one of the largest social science libraries in Brazil and Latin America. Let us support the rebuilding of the library by donating used/new books on: anthropology, archaeology, sociology, linguistics, history, and philosophy. The books will be collected over the Spring quarter once we get feedback from Museu Nacional.

Contact: Gabriela Oppitz (oppitz@stanford.ed)
Please indicate the books you are willing to donate in this form by March 31st (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ojYx97eDqoqUKBqMvFtPHOfuJDpS1kQ19TOt3BYjnaw/edit?usp=sharing)
