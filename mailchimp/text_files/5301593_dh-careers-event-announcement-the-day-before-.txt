This panel showcases careers beyond academia in fields which share an affinity with the digital humanities, including digital publishing, educational technology, and software development. Our panelists, whose roles span product management to program development to content production, all chose to pursue PhDs in the humanities and then to build their professional future in industry. We'll hear about their paths into their current positions, the day-to-day of their current work, and what graduate students hoping to follow in their footsteps need to know.

Our panelists:

Alexis Charles, Learning Program Manager at Meta
PhD in Modern Thought and Literature, Stanford University

Erin Glass, Manager of Developer Education at Digital Ocean
PhD in English with Certificate in Interactive Technology and Pedagogy, CUNY

George Philip LeBordais, Head of Partnerships at Polygence
PhD in Art History, Stanford University

Max Suechting, K12 Content Lead at Adobe for Education
PhD Candidate in Modern Thought and Literature, Stanford University

Steel Wagstaff, Product Manager at Pressbooks
PhD in English and MLIS, University of Wisconsin
