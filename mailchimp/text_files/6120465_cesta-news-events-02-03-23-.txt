Christine Philliou
Professor, UC Berkeley
Firuzan Melike Sümertaş
Visiting Scholar, UC Berkeley
Assistant Professor, İstanbul Kent University


Tuesday, February 7 | 12-1.15 PM | Wallenberg 433A

We founded the İstanΠόλις Collaborative in 2020 to serve as an online hub for studies on the spatial/physical and demographic aspects of the Rum/Greek Orthodox presence in Istanbul between 1821 and 1923 and have been developing a range of Digital Humanities projects that link up to it. We will speak about how the Collaborative came to be, the scholarly questions we are addressing, the need for such a project both for scholarly and public domains, and the Digital Humanities methodologies we are developing to realize the project. We will also discuss the range of archival sources we have been using and the ways we have been discussing and processing those sources together.

Cosponsored with the Department of History (https://history.stanford.edu/)  and theAbbasi Program in Islamic Studies (https://islamicstudies.stanford.edu/)

The presentation will include lunch and take place at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis in Wallenberg 433A. A Zoom link is available upon request from Center Manager, Jonathan Clark (jclark93@stanford.edu (mailto:jclark93@stanford.edu) ).
