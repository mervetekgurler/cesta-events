Dear CESTA community,

A reminder that tomorrow evening is our social gathering: we look forward to finally reconnecting in person and greeting new friends!

Please have your green Health Check badge ready to show upon arrival. There will be an alternative for those who cannot use Health Check, but having your badge ready will speed everything up!
