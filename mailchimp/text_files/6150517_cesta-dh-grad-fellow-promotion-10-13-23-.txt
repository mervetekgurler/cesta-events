Applications for the Graduate Digital Humanities Fellows Program (https://cesta.stanford.edu/graduate-programs/digital-humanities-fellows-program) are now open, and due October 31st! Learn more about the DH Fellows program at next weekâ€™s Lunch & Learn (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/lunch-and-learn-cesta-dh-fellows-program)  and explore the program on the CESTA webpage (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/applications-now-open-cestas-undergraduate-graduate-programs) .

CESTA's Digital Humanities Fellows Program (https://cesta.stanford.edu/graduate-programs/digital-humanities-fellows-program)  is designed to prepare graduate students for a future where digital scholarship is the norm. This year the program is tailored to advanced graduate students (ABD) and recent PhDs with digital projects that would benefit from integration into a community of scholars and practitioners, participation in curated workshops, and, perhaps most importantly, receive two quarters (up to 150 hours) of dedicated support from an undergraduate research intern.

To foster a community of practice, fellows gather for weekly meetings with their cohort. The program of meetings typically includes:
* Skills workshops
* Seminars from DH practitioners
* Works-in-progress presentations
* Graduate reading group
