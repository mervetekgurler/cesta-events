DH Long View Seminar Series Launches Tomorrow

This seminar series (https://cestastanford.github.io/) is co-hosted by scholars living in three countries, nine time zones apart. Building upon the successful “Digital Humanities Longview” series (2021), this is a further bridging of trans-Atlantic digital humanities centres to promote a global conversation. We are committed to fostering rich international discussions from a diverse range of perspectives, with an emphasis on reflective practice.

Co-hosted by UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, the Centre for Digital Humanities, Uppsala, & the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis, Stanford.
March 10, 2022. 9:00AM PST.

This talk will examine the emerging areas of research in Digital Humanities in India by an examination of the term “Digital Humanities” and its uneven and uncertain trajectory in the Indian research ecosystem. As with other systems around the world, DH in India is complex and contextual and each of us involved in the disciplinary practice encounter resistance and skepticism. Resistance to what is perceived as a deliberate distancing from the larger Humanities queries, scepticism about appropriating the rhetoric of STEM disciplines merely as a tool for greater legitimacy and validation. But of course DH is far more than a sum of its criticisms and scepticisms. I will address why it is imperative that the digital be harnessed, critiqued, deconstructed and dissected precisely so that the issues that Humanities scholars have been invested in continue to be at the centre of the development, deployment and dissemination of technology.

About these talks: Individual-level records are a treasure trove of information about the histories of unaccounted people in the Cape Colony and South Africa. Over the last four years, scholars within the Biography of an Uncharted People project have transcribed large administrative archival sources – marriage records, death notices, voters’ rolls – and analysed these using innovative new methods and tools. This presentation discusses the results of one focus area of the project: Cape slavery. But it is not just the production of research that benefits from Digital History approaches. We showcase one method of research dissemination that has much potential: an art exhibition.

This event is part of the “Reframing Enslaved Pasts” series, which is organized by Grant Parker and James T. Campbell. "Reframing Enslaved Pasts" is a Global Research Workshop (https://sgs.stanford.edu/news-eventsevents/global-research-workshops)  which discusses critical data practices around enslaved pasts, focusing on the methods and choices that underlie digital data projects.
