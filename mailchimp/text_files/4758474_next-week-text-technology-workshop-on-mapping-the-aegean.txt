MapAeg is aimed at the study and the promotion of knowledge of the Liber Insularum Archipelagi (1420) by the Florentine traveler Cristoforo Buondelmonti. This book can be considered the first guide to the Greek islands, each of them described by a textual paragraph and illustrated by colour maps, in a format which gave rise to the new literary genre of Isolaria. The goal of the project is the creation of a digital edition of this text based on the ms Gennadios Library, Athens, 71, a manuscript presenting the full Latin text illustrated with good quality illustrations of all the islands. The edition includes a facsimile, transcription and an English translation and is accompanied by a commentary which addresses geographical, historical and archaeological questions. An important component is represented by the annotations of the map drawings and their connection to GIS.

Given the intrinsic, highly multi-disciplinary nature of this work, and the potential for its growth well beyond its original boundaries, we need a technological approach which, way beyond a text-based digital edition, best ensures the possibility of stacking more and more layers of specialized information about the edited text, at any time during or even after the project completion. This will allow starting with an essential set of metadata, and progressively increase and specialize it with eventual contributions from different scholars.
