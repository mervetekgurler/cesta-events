This Week at CESTA

Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series:  Recuperating Forgotten Narratives  (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/mellon-sawyer-seminar-series-recuperating-forgotten-narratives-marlene-daut-0)
Monday, April 8 | 5:30 - 7:00 PM | Wallenberg Hall 433A

Previous seminars in our series have attended to divisions, but also possibilities, engendered by data along various fault lines and contexts (from 19th-century statistical thinking to biases in archives, from the challenges of quantification to the history of data governance). With this seminar on ‘Recuperating Forgotten Narratives’ we focus on what happens to text when it is digitized and turned into data. What new possibilities open up with this type of textual data? What new narratives can be written about past and present textual traditions? What remains irretrievable?

This is the fifth event in the Mellon Sawyer Seminar series, The Data that Divides Us: Recalibrating Data Methods for New Knowledge Frameworks Across the Humanities, generously funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. During Stanford University's 2023-24 academic year, the Sawyer Seminar Series will convene scholars from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and personal standpoints to discuss the data that has saturated our world. Professor Marlene Daut will talk about how digitizing and making accessible early 19th-century Haitian print culture can act as a kind of counter-exhibit, both to actual exhibits and in general to the way that Haiti is portrayed across various types of media. Following the talk, there will be a response by Matt Randolph (PhD candidate in History at Stanford).

There will be a reception at 5 pm prior to the talk. If you cannot attend in person, you can register for a Zoom link here (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0qdOuqpzsuHd00tRhtbdI-c7vHjdIvaIAP#/registration) .
Marlene L. Daut is Professor of French and African American Studies at Yale University. Her books include Tropics of Haiti: Race and the Literary History of the Haitian Revolution in the Atlantic World; Baron de Vastey and the Origins of Black Atlantic Humanism; and Awakening the Ashes: An Intellectual History of the Haitian Revolution. Her articles on Haitian history and culture have appeared in The New Yorker, The New York Times, Harper’s Bazaar, Essence, The Nation, and the LA Review of Books. She has won several awards, grants, and fellowships for her contributions to historical and cultural understandings of the Caribbean, notably from the Ford Foundation, the American Council of Learned Societies, the Haitian Studies Association, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Most recently, she won a grant from the Robert Silvers Foundation for her forthcoming biography, The First and Last King of Haiti: The Rise and Fall of Henry Christophe.  She is also co-creator and co-editor of
H-Net Commons’ digital platform, H-Haiti (https://networks.h-net.org/h-haiti)  with Julia Gaffield and curator of a website on early Haitian print culture at http://lagazetteroyale.com  (http://lagazetteroyale.com/) ; see also her online bibliography of fictions of the Haitian Revolution from 1787 to 1900 at the website http://haitianrevolutionaryfictions.com (http://haitianrevolutionaryfictions.com/)

SRC Fellowship Info Session
Wednesday, April 10 | 12:00 - 1:00 PM | Wallenberg Hall 433A

On Wednesday, April 10^th between 12 and 1 pm, Stanford Research Computing (SRC) will be coming to CESTA to talk about their programming in general and the 2^nd annual SRC Fellowship for Humanities and Social Sciences graduate students. SRC invites graduate students in the Humanities and Social Sciences to apply for a Summer Quarter fellowship to develop original digital research in our high-performance computing environment. There are three fellowships available, with the awardees forming a learning cohort. Each fellowship comes with a $5,000 stipend, as well as office space in Polya Hall. The recipients will be expected to give a final presentation on their project at the end of the quarter. Those interested should complete the form  (https://forms.gle/FsTEi6gFvZAmvvac9) here (https://forms.gle/FsTEi6gFvZAmvvac9)  by April 23.

Please RSVP below to attend the information luncheon. All Humanities and Social Sciences graduate students are invited to attend. There is a Zoom option available as well.

Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series:  Catastrophe, Data and Transformation (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/mellon-sawyer-seminar-series-catastrophe-data-and-transformation-dagomar-degroot-and-jessica)
Thursday, April 11 | 5:30 - 7:00 PM | Wallenberg Hall 433A

Historically, catastrophes and disaster occasioned early efforts at social data collection. With these data before them, early modern authorities considered how best to respond to disaster and ward off recurrence. Meanwhile, modern catastrophes have inspired examinations of premodern data with an eye to understanding the deep patterns of the longue durée, with hopes of yielding not only a better understanding of the past, but also actionable data relevant to our contemporary crises.

This workshop interrogates the historical relationship between disaster and data. How have catastrophe and data collection have fed into and conditioned historical transformation? How did the accumulation of biopower develop in the early modern world? What patterns and practices of catastrophe and transformation can human and non-human data illuminate?

Dagomar Degroot and Jessica Otis examine early modern catastrophe through a variety of data sources, from early modern human data through physical and biological data which evidence past disasters. Please join us for a conversation about catastrophe, data, and transformation.

There will be a reception at 5 pm prior to the event. If you cannot attend in person, you can register for a Zoom link here (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0ucuyrqzovHtbS6DmuGa5QXWsHjlJjjslb#/registration) .


Jessica Otis is Assistant Professor of History and Director of Public Projects at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. Her book By the Numbers: Numeracy, Religion, and the Quantitative Transformation of Early Modern England (Oxford University Press, 2024) explores how changing technologies of knowledge impacted how early modern people understood and interacted with the world around them. Her NSF-funded Death by Numbers project (deathbynumbers.org (http://deathbynumbers.org/) ) is transcribing, publishing, and quantitatively analyzing the London Bills of Mortality in order to investigate how lived experiences of plague outbreaks intersected with an emerging quantitative mentality among the people of early modern England. She is also one of the Project Directors of the NEH-funded Mathematical Humanists Institute for Advanced Topics in Digital Humanities, which is offering a series of workshops on the mathematics that underpins common DH methods.
Dagomar Degroot is an associate professor of environmental history at Georgetown University. His first book, The Frigid Golden Age, was published by Cambridge University Press in 2018 and named by the Financial Times as one of the ten best history books of that year. His forthcoming book, Ripples on the Cosmic Ocean, is under contract with Harvard University Press and Viking, and he is editing several books on past climate change - including the Oxford Handbook of Resilience in Climate History. Degroot publishes equally in historical and scientific journals, including Nature and the American Historical Review, and writes for a popular audience in, for example, the Washington Post, Aeon Magazine, and The Conversation. He maintains popular online resources on the history of climate change, and has shared the unique perspectives of the past with policymakers, corporate leaders, and journalists in many cities, from Wuhan to Washington, DC.
