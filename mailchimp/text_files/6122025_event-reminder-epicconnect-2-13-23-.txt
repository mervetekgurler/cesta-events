** Building EdTech from the Inside Out: Challenges and Opportunities of EpicConnect (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/fyza-parviz-jazra-nelson-shuchmacher-endebo-and-ellis-schriefer-building-edtech-inside-out)
------------------------------------------------------------
Fyza Parviz Jazra, Nelson Shuchmacher Endebo and Ellis Schriefer

Stanford University
Tuesday, February 14 | 12-1.15 PM | Wallenberg 433A

EpicConnect is an education technology product specifically designed to benefit community college instructors, and it is being built at CESTA. It is an open-source productivity platform that leverages Behavior Design principles to build community, enhance belonging, and help instructors collaborate on pedagogical projects. But something like EpicConnect cannot happen overnight, and in this presentation the co-founders of the project will share what they have learned, from product discovery and designing prototypes to user testing and the challenges and opportunities of creating user-centered tech for education.

This seminar is co-sponsored by Stanford Global Studies (https://sgs.stanford.edu/) .

The presentation will include lunch and take place at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis in Wallenberg 433A. A Zoom link is available upon request from Center Manager, Jonathan Clark (jclark93@stanford.edu (mailto:jclark93@stanford.edu) ).
