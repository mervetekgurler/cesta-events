News & Announcements
CESTA/CIDR Lightning Talks! (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/cestacidr-dh-lightning-talks)
Tuesday, April 25th |  12 - 1:15 PM

Mark your calendars: CESTA and CIDR will once again be co-hosting a session of digital humanities lightning talks on Tuesday, April 25, 12:00-1:15pm, to be held in-person at CESTA (a Zoom link is available upon request for remote attendance). The format is casual, with short 3-5 minute lightning talks followed by discussion and feedback from the group.

Anyone with an interest in digital humanities is invited to participate! This is a great opportunity to meet people working on similar methods or topics, get help with technical challenges, and gather ideas.

Let us know if you'd like to present a lightning talk by filling out this form (https://forms.gle/kTjJQXqxcpxvX8YV6)  by Monday, April 17. Weâ€™ll be in touch shortly after to confirm a final schedule. Please send any questions to Alix Keener (CESTA/CIDR Digital Scholarship Coordinator) at alixkee@stanford.edu (mailto:alixkee@stanford.edu) . We hope to see you there!
