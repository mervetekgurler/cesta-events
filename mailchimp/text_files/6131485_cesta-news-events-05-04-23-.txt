** Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online: Socially-Engaged Digital Humanities  (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/saving-ukrainian-cultural-heritage-online-socially-engaged-digital-humanities)
------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday, May 9 | 12:00 -1:15 | Wallenberg 433A

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has put cultural heritage right in the line of fire. Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online (SUCHO) is an online grassroots initiative of more than 1,500 volunteers which supports the digital preservation of Ukrainian culture. SUCHO started as an emergency web-archiving effort, preserving more than 50TB of cultural data from over 5,000 websites of Ukrainian museums, libraries and archives. In recent months SUCHO, has expanded its efforts to donating digitization hardware to Ukrainian institutions and creating online platforms for the preservation and exhibition of digitized and born-digital heritage. In this keynote, the three SUCHO co-founders and long-term volunteers will discuss what it takes to turn remote volunteers into digital activists. Furthermore, the speakers will outline the crucial role Open Access plays for the digital preservation of culture in emergency scenarios such as wars and natural disasters.

This event is cosponsored with the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.

The presentation will include lunch and take place at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis in Wallenberg 433A. A Zoom link is available upon request from Center Manager, Jonathan Clark (jclark93@stanford.edu (mailto:jclark93@stanford.edu) ).

** Rethinking the Long Eighteenth-Century: Social, Literary and Political History in Pre- and Post- Revolutionary France (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/seminar-rethinking-long-eighteenth-century)
------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday, May 11 | 2:30 - 6:00 PM | Wallenberg 433A

Home of the Enlightenment and a magnet for all of Europe, eighteenth-century France is a rich field for the study of ideas and society. The abrupt break caused by the French Revolution in 1789 and the subsequent Napoleonic era have sometimes been seen as implicit temporal boundaries to this field of study. This has been reinforced by the chosen areas of specialization of many scholars, which in many cases separate the study of the eighteenth century from the revolutionary and Napoleonic periods. In contrast, this seminar aims to rethink our understanding of the long eighteenth century in France from a broader perspective, fostering dialogue between scholars of the late seventeenth century through to the post-revolutionary period. Among the topics addressed, special attention is given to cultural practices, networks, the circulation of ideas, gender issues, inequalities, and social dynamics. Through different approaches and perspectives, the seminar sheds new light on a period characterized
by political, social and cultural changes, considering both elements of continuity and rupture.

(https://tec.fsi.stanford.edu/) The event has been sponsored by the project NapApps. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No. 101018470.
