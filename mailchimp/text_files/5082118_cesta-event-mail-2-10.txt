DH Careers Series
"DH Careers: Beyond the Professoriate"
Online, via Zoom. Register here (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAkde6prT8sHNZ2zIQfQ01fAAqv2AtH01Xk) .
Please note that this event runs later than other CESTA Seminars.

Are you a graduate student looking for a career in the digital humanities, but feeling unsure about how to proceed?

This panel showcases four graduates from humanities PhD programs who are now pursuing DH careers beyond the tenure track. They have generously agreed to share reflections on their professional trajectories to date, the day-to-day of their current work, and what graduate students hoping to follow in their footsteps need to know.

Following a one-hour panel, attendees will have the opportunity to join the panelists in break-out rooms for an informal Q&A. This event is primarily intended for graduate students and early career researchers but is open to anyone who registers, regardless of institutional affiliation or career stage.

Our panelists are:

Ashley Champagne
Head of Digital Scholarship Project Planning, Brown University Library
PhD in English, University of California Santa Barbara

Will Fenton
Program Officer, Office of Challenge Programs, National Endowment for the Humanities
PhD in English, Fordham University

Emily McGinn
Humanities Computing Curriculum Specialist, Center for Digital Humanities, Princeton University
PhD in Comparative Literature, University of Oregon

Katie McDonough
Senior Research Associate, The Alan Turing Institute
PhD in History, Stanford University
DH Careers is a quarterly panel series showcasing the many professional paths for graduates with training in the digital humanities. You can watch our previous panel here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAw1vpXPU9A) . Our next panel, later this spring, will be on “DH Careers Beyond Academia".

February 23, 2022. 5:30-7PM PST.
Critical Data Practices Workshop
Topic: Premodern Language
Hybrid workshop (in person and remote). Email Matt Warner (mailto:mattgw@stanford.edu?subject=Critical%20Data%20Practices%20workshop)  to RSVP.

As digital humanists, we work in modern languages, but we do not necessarily work on them. The technologies and resources we work with are often designed not just for particular modern languages (e.g. the focus of natural language research on English), but for particular language paradigms that are not historically immutable. For scholars working on early printed material, aligning modern tools with premodern conventions such as irregular spelling, now archaic language or rubrication is simply another part of doing work in the digital humanities, while for scholars working with manuscript sources, the problems—abbreviations, mixed use of scripts, variant letterforms and more—are even more numerous and inescapable. How do we approach these problems? What technical solutions are available, and what do we lose in implementing them? What can our work on pre-modern language teach us about how to work with modern language?
DH Longview Seminar Series Launches March 10!

This seminar series is co-hosted by scholars living in three countries, nine time zones apart. Building upon the successful “Digital Humanities Longview” series (2021), this is a further bridging of trans-Atlantic digital humanities centres to promote a global conversation. We are committed to fostering rich international discussions from a diverse range of perspectives, with an emphasis on reflective practice.

Co-hosted by UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, the Centre for Digital Humanities, Uppsala, & the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis, Stanford.
