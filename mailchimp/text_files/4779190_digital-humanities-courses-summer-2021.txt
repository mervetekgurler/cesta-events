CLASSICS 115 | ENGLISH 115 | HISTORY 238C | ITALIAN 115
Virtual Italy
Instructor: Giovanna Ceserani

Classical Italy attracted thousands of travelers throughout the 1700s. Referring to their journey as the "Grand Tour," travelers pursued intellectual passions, promoted careers, and satisfied wanderlust, all while collecting antiquities to fill museums and estates back home. What can computational approaches tell us about who traveled, where and why? We will read travel accounts; experiment with parsing; and visualize historical data. Final projects to form credited contributions to the Grand Tour Project, a cutting-edge digital platform. No prior programming experience necessary.

Prof. Giovanna Ceserani directs The Grand Tour Project (https://grandtour.stanford.edu/) and is Faculty Director of CESTA.

COMPLIT 126C
Literature, Data, and AI
Instructor: Mae Velloso-Lyons

What kind of data is literature? What different methods are available to scholars who work with it, and what are the philosophical assumptions that underpin those methods? In this course, we will survey major critical approaches to literature from the last century as well as emerging methods from the digital humanities, and try them out for ourselves. Students will construct their own portfolio of texts and each week they will (re)analyze them using a different approach; they will record their findings and reflect on their experiences in a weekly log. The course will comprise asynchronous activities (lectures, presentations, assignments, readings) and one synchronous meeting per week to discuss the readings. Approaches may include: formalism, structuralism, Marxism, psychoanalysis, critical approaches to identity and performance (gender, race, sexuality and disability), network analysis, topic modeling, stylometry, and word embeddings. No prior programming knowledge is expected. This course
will not offer detailed training in computational analysis; rather, the focus will be on the theoretical implications of computational tools. All readings will be in English.

Mae Velloso-Lyons is General Editor of the Global Medieval Sourcebook (https://sourcebook.stanford.edu/) at CESTA.
