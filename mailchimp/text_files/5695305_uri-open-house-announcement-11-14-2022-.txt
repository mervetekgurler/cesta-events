About CESTA: CESTA is Stanford's center for the digital humanities, where Stanford faculty and students cultivate research at the intersection of computing, design and the humanities. CESTA projects explore a huge variety of  research topics and employ a wide array of computational methodologies. You can see the list of projects seeking 2023 interns here (https://cesta.stanford.edu/students/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-research-internship-program) .

About the Internship Program: The Undergraduate Research Internship provides opportunities for students to work on CESTA research projects. Interns receive structured training, mentorship from faculty, and opportunities to interact with the cutting-edge methods that are driving innovative research in the digital humanities. Interns are matched with ongoing CESTA research projects where they use existing and new skills to make meaningful contributions to their research teams. The work of our URIs is published annually in the CESTA Research Anthology. You can read about the experiences of recent CESTA interns in the 2021 Research Anthology.
