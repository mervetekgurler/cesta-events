CIDR Workshop
Introduction to Python: Digital Tools and Methods for the Humanities and Social Sciences
Tuesday, September 29 from 1 - 3 pm
Via Zoom. RSVP for this event. (https://registration.cidr.link/Intro_to_Python)
For Stanford faculty, staff, and students.

This workshop (https://library.stanford.edu/events/introduction-python-digital-tools-and-methods-humanities-and-social-sciences-1) provides an introduction to the Python programming language, covering basic syntax, variables, functions, and control flow. You will learn enough Python to write basic scripts, and to allow you to explore the rich environment of Python packages available. Prior experience with programming in another language is helpful, but not required.


** FRIDAY

** Upcoming
------------------------------------------------------------

CESTA Workgroups

Remote workgroups are now forming! As part of our ongoing effort to bridge the gap created by physical distance, CESTA is organizing topical workgroups. This first set of workgroups are those proposed at our first meeting of the year and are all oriented on skills-building.

These workgroups will provide a nexus for sharing information about workshops, courses, tools, and techniques. We also hope that the workgroups can provide a space for the collaborative mutual aid that has characterized our physical workspace at CESTA.

Anyone interested in joining one of the groups now forming should email the contact listed below. There is no reason to limit our workgroups to these four; anyone is free to propose and organize another workgroup.
* Python acquisition: Laura Stokes (lpstokes@stanford.edu (mailto:lpstokes@stanford.edu) )
* Linux: Nika Mavrody (nikam@stanford.edu)
* IIIF digital object manipulation: Agnieszka Backman (abackman@stanford.edu)
* Network data and spatial analysis: Yunxin Li (yunxinli@stanford.edu)

CESTA Seminar
Distant Reading the Law
Tuesday, October 6 from 12 - 1:15 pm
Via Zoom (https://stanford.zoom.us/j/97074330700?pwd=TXp0OXJDZmd4RzRsbnQvT2c0TlpEZz09)
Free & open to the public

Dr. Hanjo Hamann introduces the concept of "distant reading" into the German legal discourse. He uses a unique corpus of sample solutions for bar exams administered in Germany since 2007 to explore what they might tell us about the knowledge required of German lawyers. By trying out various descriptive statistics, co-occurence analysis and text vectorisation, Dr. Hamann hopes to shine a light into the black box of legal education in Germany.

CIDR Workshop
Data Management Best Practices: Digital Tools and Methods for the Humanities and Social Sciences
Tuesday, October 6 from 1 - 2 pm
Via Zoom (registration link to be posted here soon (https://library.stanford.edu/events/data-management-best-practices-digital-tools-and-methods-humanities-and-social-sciences) )
For Stanford faculty, staff, and students

Scholars work with a vast amount of research materials — including primary and secondary source texts, quantitative data, audiovisual materials, spreadsheets, and miscellaneous notes, code, etc. This workshop (https://library.stanford.edu/events/data-management-best-practices-digital-tools-and-methods-humanities-and-social-sciences) will cover approaches to naming, organizing, and storing these materials that make them easier for you to find, reference, and ultimately publish. It will also cover topics like file formats and metadata conventions to make sure that the data or supplemental materials that accompany your own scholarship are able to be reused and preserved. This workshop is intended for scholars in the humanities and social sciences.

For Stanford Graduate Students
Digital Humanities Graduate Research Fellowship

Application deadline: Tuesday, October 6 (midnight)  (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe46ZeeuyxSH0SIncenZFrgUHeVMNMS9uSYiAw_zOnPysxNBA/viewform)

Through the course of the DHGF program (https://cesta.stanford.edu/dhgf) , fellows work with leading experts in digital humanities and will be prepared to enter the job market and explore future careers in digital scholarship. This year’s fellowship will offer additional resources to help students make the most of a year in which most learning will take place online.

The application is open to Stanford graduate students working on individual projects or collaborative projects with faculty. Priority is given to PhD students in the arts and humanities who have completed their required coursework or are TGR.
