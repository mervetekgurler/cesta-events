The Mellon Sawyer Postdoctoral Fellowship (https://postdocs.stanford.edu/prospective/opportunities/open-postdoctoral-position-faculty-mentor-giovanna-ceserani)

With the support of the Mellon Foundation’s Sawyer Seminar program, CESTA seeks applications for a one-year Mellon Sawyer Postdoctoral Fellowship in Digital Humanities. The postdoctoral fellow will play a leading role in organizing, administering and participating in the Mellon Sawyer seminar entitled “The Data that Divides Us: Recalibrating Data Methods for New Knowledge Frameworks Across the Humanities.”

We seek recent PhDs whose research operates at the intersection of the humanities and a relevant data-based field, including, but not limited to, data science, computer science, computational linguistics, computational social science, or information science. In addition, the successful applicant’s interests will align with the Seminar’s goal of investigating how the latency of values involving gender, race, class or the medical normal are encoded into existing data sets and the methodologies that we use to analyze them. Preference will be given to candidates whose work intersects with one or more of the critical fault lines around which the seminar will foster a sustained interdisciplinary dialogue: data before and after the digital divide; the ongoing legacies of nineteenth-century conceptions of data; and the challenge posed by premodern conceptions of scale and individual realities to our contemporary methods of analyzing the distant past. Scholars in any relevant discipline and working
on any time period are welcome to apply.

The Fellowship carries a twelve-month appointment beginning September 1, 2023 and a salary of $70,500, benefits and an annual research stipend. To apply, candidates must have completed all requirements for their doctoral degree after June 30, 2020 and before July 31, 2023.

To apply, submit all materials to jclark93@stanford.edu (mailto:jclark93@stanford.edu)  by April 17, 2023, 5:00 p.m. (PST) and arrange for two reference writers to submit letters by the same deadline. More information on the Fellowship and the application process can be found here.
