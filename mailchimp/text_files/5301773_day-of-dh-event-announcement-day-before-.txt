Day of DH 2022 (https://dhcenternet.org/initiatives/day-of-dh/2022)  is happening Thursday, April 28th! This is an annual global event (organized by centerNet) where digital humanists around the world share what they do with the community.
We invite you to stop by CESTA from 9:00-10:30am for a kickoff breakfast to meet, mingle, visit the space, or even hang out and get a little work done. Then from 2:30-4:00pm, Alix Keener, Digital Scholarship Coordinator in CESTA, will have open DH office hours to answer questions about DH tools and methods, digital publishing, and anything else on your mind. Annie Lamar and Merve Tekgurler, 2021-22 graduate mentors for the URI (https://cesta.stanford.edu/programs/undergraduate-research-assistant-program/about-undergraduate-research-intern-program)  program at CESTA, will also be there and ready to answer questions about what undergraduate students can do at CESTA.
Weâ€™ll be tweeting about our activities throughout the day using the hashtag #DayofDH2022, and we encourage you to do the same!
Please get in touch with Alix (alixkee@stanford.edu (mailto:alixkee@stanford.edu) ) with any questions.
