CESTA welcomes seniors, juniors, and others back to campus this term, even as we continue to operate remotely and hold all events on Zoom. Our transnational seminar series, the Digital Humanities Long View (https://cestastanford.github.io/) , that we launched in January in partnership with the Centre for Digital Humanities at UCL, continues this term. We are also happy to announce more events in our longstanding CESTA Seminar Series (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/series/cesta-seminar-series) and with Stanford's Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research (https://library.stanford.edu/research/cidr) (CIDR).
