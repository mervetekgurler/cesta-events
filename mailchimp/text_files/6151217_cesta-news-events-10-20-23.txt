Next Week at CESTA

Estelle Freedman and Natalie Marine-Street
Data Mining, Meta-Data, Encoding, and More: Mixed Methods Analyses of Oral History Narratives (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/estelle-freedman-and-natalie-marine-street-data-mining-meta-data-encoding-and-more-mixed)

Tuesday, October 24 | 12:00-1:15 PM | Lane History Corner, Room 307

How can textual analysis methods help historians to utilize the archival trove of oral histories that have been digitized in the past decade, along with those interviews born digital?

The Stanford Oral History Text Analysis Project, which we created to explore twentieth-century women’s narratives of sexual assault and harassment, has compiled a corpus of 2500 oral history transcripts from varied U.S. repositories. We developed a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, including an original search tool, called Winnow; NVivo coding; metadata/coding analysis; and close reading. At this presentation we will illustrate how combining these methods help us understand which women recalled which types of sexual violence, the ways they spoke about them, and how these narratives changed over time. In addition to the implications of the results for our understanding of sexual violence, these mixed methods can be applied to any research topic. Our work encourages oral historians and archivists to adopt standard practices in order to enable widescale textual analysis of digital oral history transcripts.

This event is cosponsored with the Department of History.

The presentation will include lunch and take place in the Lane History Corner, Room 307. A Zoom link is available upon request from Office Management Intern, Daniela Perez (perezd20@stanford.edu (mailto:perezd20@stanford.edu) ).

CESTA News & Announcements
Stanford Receives Major Mellon Foundation Award to be hosted at  CESTA (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/stanford-receives-major-mellon-foundation-award-be-hosted-center-spatial-and-textual-analysis)

A project overseen by Professors Giovanna Ceserani (Classics), Mark Algee-Hewitt (English), Grant Parker (Classics and African & African American Studies), and Laura Stokes (History) will be supported by a prestigious grant from the Mellon Foundation, which will provide up to $224,000 for a year of programming. The Mellon Seminar entitled The Data that Divides Us: Recalibrating Data Methods for New Knowledge Frameworks Across the Humanities will convene scholars from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and personal standpoints to discuss the data that has saturated our world.

“We are just thrilled,” said the faculty PIs. “The Sawyer Seminar allows us to support a sustained group conversation, including postdoc and graduates, and is a boon for CESTA (https://cesta.stanford.edu/)  and more in general the digital humanities and the crossing of data and humanities on our campus. And we are eagerly looking forward to a full year of critical conversations with our colleagues, students, and various communities.”

The PIs are interested in how the latency of values involving gender, race, class, and the medical normal are encoded within existing data sets and the methodologies used to analyze them. In a series of workshops, the seminar will interrogate the underlying assumptions in the collection, conceptualization, and application of data as these have developed in the last three centuries.

How has this data shaped contemporary manifestations of historical divisions even as it has created new social, cultural, and political fissures? And how might data help us to redress or speak across the very divisions that it has engendered?

Crucial to the success of the seminar will be the involvement of emerging scholars. For this reason, the Mellon Sawyer award supports early-career fellows who will conduct research in parallel with seminar. The selected fellows represent a variety of disciplinary backgrounds in the humanities.
Applications Now Open: The Digital Humanities Fellows Program (https://cesta.stanford.edu/graduate-programs/digital-humanities-fellows-program)

Over two quarters (Winter and Spring), fellows will enter a community of practice that features workshops with special guests tailored to the needs of the cohort, works-in-progress presentations from fellows, and guidance from scholars and practitioners across campus. Each DH Fellow will benefit from two quarters of support from an undergraduate research intern whose interests and expertise closely align with the research project.

To foster a community of practice, fellows gather for weekly meetings with their cohort. The program of meetings typically includes:
* Skills workshops
* Seminars from DH practitioners
* Works-in-progress presentations
* Graduate reading group

Learn about last year's cohort (https://cesta.stanford.edu/people/dh-fellows)  or see the full list of fellows' projects (https://cesta.stanford.edu/graduate-programs/alumni) .
Applications Now Open: (https://cesta.stanford.edu/students/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-research-internship-program) Undergraduate Research Internship Program (https://cesta.stanford.edu/students/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-research-internship-program)

The Undergraduate Research Internship (https://cesta.stanford.edu/students/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-research-internship-program) program empowers students to apply technologies across the Humanities and Social Sciences in ways that enhance our understanding of the world. Applications for the 2023-24 program are due November 22, 2023.

The Undergraduate Research Internship provides opportunities for undergraduates to work on CESTA research projects throughout the academic year. Through structured research training, experimentation with cutting-edge technologies, and faculty mentorship, students develop valuable academic and professional skill sets. Work on lab projects allows students to apply their developing expertise in data science, GIS, and web development in tandem with humanities skills in critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and ethical decision-making.
