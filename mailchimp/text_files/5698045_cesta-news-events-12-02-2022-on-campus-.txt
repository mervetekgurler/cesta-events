About the Internship Program: The Undergraduate Research Internship provides opportunities for students to work on faculty- and graduate-led research projects. Program terms include winter, spring and summer quarter, and include both part-time and full-time opportunities. Our interns receive structured training, mentorship, and opportunities to interact with the cutting-edge methods that are driving innovative research in the digital humanities. Interns are matched with ongoing projects where they use existing and new skills to make meaningful contributions to their research teams. Work by our URIs is published annually in the CESTA Research Anthology. You can read about the experiences of recent CESTA interns in the 2021 Research Anthology.
