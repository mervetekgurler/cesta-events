Wednesday, April 24 | 4:00 - 7:00 PM | Fry Gunn Rotunda, Neurosciences Building

Join us for a co-hosted lecture on "Data Feminism for AI" with Professor Lauren Klein (Departments of English and Quantitative Theory and Methods at Emory University).  The talk will be centered around on how principles around Data Feminism can be applied to conversations around AI in our current technological landscape. The lecture will be followed up by a panel featuring Professors Adrian Daub and Chiara Sabatti of Stanford University. The talk will be followed up by a reception. RSVP is necessary for entry.

In Data Feminism (MIT Press, 2020), Klein and her coauthor Catherine D'Ignazio established a set of principles for doing more just and equitable data science. Informed by the past several decades of intersectional feminist activism and critical thought, the principles of data feminism modeled how to examine and challenge power, rethink binaries and hierarchies, elevate emotion and embodiment, consider context, embrace pluralism, and make labor visible. How can these principles be applied to the current conversation about AI, its present harms, and its future possibilities? This talk will briefly summarize the principles of data feminism before moving to a set of examples that show how these principles can be applied–and extended–in our current technological landscape.

This talk is co-hosted by the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) (https://cesta.stanford.edu/)  and Stanford Data Science. It is co-sponsored by Stanford University Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) (https://hai.stanford.edu/) , The Clayman Institute for Gender Research (https://gender.stanford.edu/)  and theStanford Humanities Center.  (https://shc.stanford.edu/)

Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series:
Data of Enslavement (Lauren Klein, Alex Borucki, and Gregory O'Malley) (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/mellon-sawyer-seminar-series-data-enslavement-lauren-klein-alex-borucki-and-gregory-omalley)
Thursday, April 25 | 3:00 - 4:30 PM | Wallenberg Hall, Room 433a

Enslavement has been the subject of many big data projects, and some of them have gained enormous prominence in American and transatlantic studies. In their quantitative emphasis, based for example on shipping records, many such studies have diverged from more humanistic approaches, for which the focus has sometimes been on individuals whose lives are reconstructed in micro-narratives. While the scholarly value of big data in studying enslavement is beyond dispute, new projects come at a troubling moment in US history: for many North Americans, the legacies of enslavement are very much to the fore amidst heightened racial tensions and deepening economic inequalities. If, in such an environment, the term @nomorenames is politically significant, what implications might there be for scholarship? Is it possible that scholars with their data practices—even unconsciously and unwillingly—are adding new epistemological violence to the physical violence of the past?

Join us on April 25th at 3 pm, for the "Data of Enslavement", the 7th session of our year-long Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series. We will hear from Lauren Klein, Alex Borucki, and Greg O'Malley about how they bring in humanistic approaches to large historical datasets in this sensitive theme and how they use these historical data to understand injustices in our contemporary world.

If you cannot attend in person, you can request Zoom information via this link (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMvdeCoqT4pGtJ4PCAi24AJcmDCOKs2Py2p#/registration) .

Before the seminar, there will be a reception with appetizers starting at 2:30 pm.
