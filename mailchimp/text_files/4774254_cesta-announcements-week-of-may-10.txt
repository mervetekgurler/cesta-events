Counting Images: Creating a Database of Black Characters from Imperial Rio de Janeiro's Illustrated Press

with Marcelo Balaban (University of Brasilia)
Online via Zoom
Register for this event (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJItcuqrqDkrG9UhrYZahcOcD4SeR_vxR9AT)
This presentation is part of a major study on caricatures of African Brazilians — citizens and enslaved — published in Rio de Janeiro’s illustrated press in the 19th century. The main intention of this research is to analyze the production of racism, the resistance to it, and the process of social racialization from the 1860s until the aftermath of slavery. To achieve this purpose, the project deals with different kinds of sources, including parliamentary debates, policy documentation, and newspapers. In order to deal with both qualitative and quantitative approaches, a large database of African-Brazilian caricatures has been created. Debating some of the challenges and advantages of using this method to interpret caricatures is the main purpose of this presentation.

Marcelo Balaban is Professor of Brazilian History at University of Brasilia, Brazil and author of the books Poet of Crayon: Satire and Politics on Angelo Agostini's Trajectory in Imperial Brazil (1864-1888) [Poeta do Lápis: Sátira e Política na trajetória de Angelo Agostini no Brasil Imperial (1864-1888)] and Markers of Difference: Race and Racism in Brazilian History — edited with Gabriela Sampaio and Ivana Lima [Marcadores da Diferença: Raça e Racismo na História do Brasil], among others. His current research is about images of Black characters — enslaved, free and freed — in Rio de Janeiro's Illustrated Press during the second half of the 19th century.

Complicating the whiteness of Digital Humanities: the Deep History of Black DH

with Amy Earhart (Texas A&M)
Online via Zoom

While projects focused on Black culture, texts, and artifacts are not as rare as they once were, there remains a lack of understanding of the rich and deep histories of Black DH and its impact on the field. Sharon Leon’s foundation chapter, “Complicating a ‘Great Man’ Narrative of Digital History in the United States,” serves as a model of the necessary documentation that scholars must compile of alternative histories of digital humanities. Accordingly, this talk will document a deep dig into the ecology of digital humanities, centering Black DH work in the field. Among the scholars’ work discussed will be Abduhl Alkalimat (creator of e-black studies), Bryan Carter (Virtual Harlem), Marilyn Miller Thomas-Houston (iBlack Studies and co-editor of the multi-media journal Fire!!!), Ronald Bailey (dignubia.org, nubianet.org, and AFRO Publishing Without Walls), and Maryemma Graham (History of Black Writing). An ongoing project, I am conducting interviews with such foundational Black dh scholars
to better understand their contributions to the field.

Involved with digital humanities scholarship since 2003, Amy Earhart’s scholarship has focused on examining infrastructures of technology and their impact and replication of “race,” building infrastructure for digital humanities work, embedding digital humanities projects within the classroom, and tracing the history and futures of dh, with a particular interest in the way that dh and critical race studies intersect.

This talk is the seventh in the Digital Humanities Long View Seminar Series (https://cestastanford.github.io/) , co-organized by UCL-DH and CESTA.
