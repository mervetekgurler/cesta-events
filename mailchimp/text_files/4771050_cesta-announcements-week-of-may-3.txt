About this event: OpenGulf is a transdisciplinary, multi-institutional research group creating digital infrastructures for a community of scholars working on historical projects related to the Arabian Peninsula, Iran, and Iraq. The complexity of multi-archive, multi-lingual source material is a key challenge for digital historical research in Gulf Studies. Existing digital archives have focused on British imperial sources and scholars have used these resources as they would a physical archive. OpenGulf operates at multiple scales and uses sources from diverse imperial and linguistic traditions to build the groundwork for digital work in Gulf Studies that centers new voices. Our presentation will introduce three interrelated OpenGulf projects: developing multi-hand models for automatic transcription of nineteenth-century letters using Transkribus; preparing, annotating, and mapping printed historical texts in Arabic, Ottoman Turkish, French, and English with Transkribus and Recogito; and
digitizing and analyzing early twentieth-century Ottoman maps depicting population groups and bounded territories in Iraq and Arabia.

OpenGulf (https://opengulf.github.io//) was founded in 2018 by David Joseph Wrisley, Associate Professor of Digital Humanities at New York University Abu Dhabi, and Nora Barakat, Assistant Professor of History at Stanford. Joining them to introduce OpenGulf will be Camille Cole, Junior Research Fellow at Jesus College, Cambridge; Nada Ammagui, Arts & Humanities Postgraduate Research Fellow at NYU Abu Dhabi and recent graduate of the NYUAD Arab Crossroads Studies Program; and Mohammed Khalil, a sophomore at Stanford tentatively majoring in English and Computer Science and a CESTA intern working with OpenGulf.
