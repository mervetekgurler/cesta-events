News & Announcements

Introducing the Sawyer Graduate Reading Group

Happy New Year, digital-enthusiast humanists of Stanford!
The Sawyer Graduate Reading Group is convening in the Winter and Fall to discuss applications of “The Data that Divide Us.” Our programming compliments the Mellon Sawyer Seminar (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/stanford-receives-major-mellon-foundation-award-be-hosted-center-spatial-and-textual-analysis?search=mellon+sawyer)  offerings, with a focus on bringing graduate students in the humanities into the conversation.

In Winter, we will discuss the work of two Stanford researchers: Quinn Dombrowski and Anne Ladyem McDivitt. Quinn’s work focuses on multilingual computational text analysis. Anne Ladyem is a historian with a focus on digital and public history. After reading and discussing their work, the data they use, the challenges it presents, and the methods they use to overcome those challenges, we will meet with Quinn and Anne Ladyem to ask questions and hear firsthand their perspectives and experiences on the management of textual and geospatial data, and the broader use of data in humanistic research.

In the Spring, we will turn to the research of the Sawyer Seminar's invited speakers (Dagomar Degroot, Jessica Otis, Greg O'Malley, Alex Borucki, Lauren Klein), again focusing on the theoretical issues engendered by these scholars' data sources and the practical methods that these researchers avail themselves of in their approach to data.

All Stanford Humanities graduates are welcome! Mark your calendars for January 16, January 23, February 13, February 20, April 2, April 16, and May 7. These are all Tuesdays, and meetings will take place between 12:00-1:15. Wallenberg 434. Lunch will be provided.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Your Mellon Sawyer Dissertation Fellows,

Chloé Brault (PhD Candidate in Comparative Literature) and
Matt Warner (PhD Candidate in English)

Black Digital Humanities Symposium (https://blackdigitalhumanities.com/symposium/)

In an era of rapid technological advancements and shifting global dynamics, Black Digital Humanities (BDH) stands as a crucial area for understanding and influencing these changes, particularly as they relate to Black experiences and futures. We invite graduate students, practitioners, community activists, and artists to contribute to our symposium, which aims to harness BDH's transformative potential. The Black Digital Humanities lab, in collaboration with the Center for Africana Digital Humanities at Clark Atlanta, invites submissions for its inaugural 2024 Digital Humanities symposium. The event will take place April 12, 2024 online. Deadlines for submission are February 23rd. Learn more about the event and submit your proposals at  https://blackdigitalhumanities.com/symposium/.
