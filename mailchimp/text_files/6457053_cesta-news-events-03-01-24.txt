Roundtable on Digital Environmental Humanities (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/roundtable-digital-environmental-humanities)
Tuesday, March 5 | 12:00 - 1:15 PM | Wallenberg Hall, Room 433A

An event hosted by CESTA, and co-sponsored by Woods Institute for Environment.

We will be meeting on March 5th, Tuesday, between 12 and 1:15 pm for a roundtable on Digital Environmental Humanities (DEH) with esteemed Professors Mark Algee-Hewitt, Zephyr Frank, and Deborah Gordon. We will talk about what it means to approach a Digital Humanities project from an environmentally conscious perspective, and how to use Digital Humanities tools to analyze objects and materials embedded in their local environment and ecology. Lunch will be provided.

The leading questions for the session will be: how does the "time" of the objects observed matter for the pace of DEH projects? How much does the ongoing climate crisis affect perspectives of time observed and time it takes in DEH projects? How does the uncertainty of survivability for the observed subjects and objects, and visions of catastrophe for ecologies affect our perspectives on DEH projects? Does it create any urgency?

RSVP  (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHa2cRhT5e9VJw0rwreaatntbWmEiQsdMYuhejbwS1xzDO6w/viewform) is encouraged, but you can also attend without RSVPing.

If you have any questions, email eeyurek@stanford.edu (mailto:eeyurek@stanford.edu) .


Zephyr Frank is Gildred Professor of Latin American Studies, Professor at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, Senior Fellow at the Woods Institute for the Environment and professor, by courtesy, of Iberian and Latin American Cultures. He was also the founding Director of the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) 2011-16.  His research interests focus on Brazilian social and cultural history, the study of wealth and inequality, and the digital humanities.


Deborah M. Gordon is a Professor in the Department of Biology at Stanford University. She studies how ant colonies work without central control using networks of simple interactions, and how these networks evolve in relation to changing environments. She received her PhD from Duke University, then joined the Harvard Society of Fellows, and did postdoctoral research at Oxford and the University of London before joining the Stanford faculty in 1991. Projects include a long-term study of a population of harvester ant colonies in Arizona, studies of the invasive Argentine ant in northern California, arboreal ant trail networks and ant-plant mutualisms in Central America.

Mark Algee-Hewitt’s research focuses on the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in England and Germany and seeks to combine literary criticism with digital and quantitative analyses of literary texts. In particular he is interested in the history of aesthetic theory and the development and transmission of aesthetic and philosophic concepts during the Enlightenment and Romantic periods. He is also interested in the relationship between aesthetic theory and the poetry of the long eighteenth century.  Although his primary background is in English literature, he also has a degree in computer science. As the director of the Stanford Literary Lab, he is working to bring his interests in quantitative analysis, digital humanities and eighteenth-century literature to bear on a number of new collaborative projects. His current book project, The Afterlife of the Sublime, explores the history of the sublime by tracing its discursive patterns through over 11,000 texts from the long eighteenth
century, seeking clues to the disappearance of the term at the end of the Romantic period. As a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at McGill University, working with the Interacting with Print Research group, Dr. Algee-Hewitt was also involved in a variety of projects that combine literary interpretation with quantitative analysis. He is a co-coordinator of the Book History BiblioGraph, a new dynamic online resource and recommendation engine that visualizes connections between contemporary resources on Book History using statistical methods. He is also working with Andrew Piper on the Werther Topologies: a project that seeks to identify lexical patterns that will aid in tracing the impact of Goethe’s Sorrows of Young Werther on the nineteenth-century development of the German novel. Dr. Algee-Hewitt has taught a variety of courses in literary history and theory in both the English and German departments at McGill University, Rutgers University and New York University where he received his PhD in
2008.

Genealogy, Islam and sorcery in post-abolition Brazil: Digital Humanities for African Diaspora Histories (https://shc.stanford.edu/stanford-humanities-center/events/bruno-veras-genealogy-islam-and-sorcery-post-abolition-brazil)
with Bruno Véras

Friday, March 8 | 1:00 - 2:30 PM | Stanford Humanities Center, Board Room

The third winter quarter meeting of the Slavery and Freedom research workshop will feature Bruno Véras (University of Toronto).

This workshop intends to discuss digital humanities methodologies and individual trajectories of Alufás (Muslim leaders) in Brazil. It is divided into two sections. First, the participants will be introduced to the historical context of late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Brazil and its Islamic communities, notably in its capital, Rio de Janeiro. The life of an Alufá known as tio [uncle] Sany will be a guiding trajectory to analyze migration phenomenon, anti-black legislation and community-building strategies among Muslim Africans in post-slavery Brazil. Secondly, in a practical manner, the audience will experiment with several digital repositories. Through guided exercises, the participants will use several resource websites to search and analyze manuscripts, printed materials and iconographic primary sources where the histories of tio Sany and other Alufás were documented. This way, through exposition and practical exercises, this workshop will discuss historiography,
transnational diasporic contexts and digital methodologies.

Debabelization: Language Literature, and Computational Culture  (https://shc.stanford.edu/stanford-humanities-center/events/aarthi-vadde-debabelization-language-literature-and-computational)
with Aarthi Vadde

Tuesday, March 12 | 5:30 - 7:00 PM | Stanford Humanities Center, Board Room

“Debabelization,” as linguist C.K. Ogden put it in 1931, motivated rich debates about whether technological intervention could make particular languages more efficient agents of cultural exchange. Aarthi Vadde, Associate Professor of English at Duke University, will consider how the competitive and techno-utopian discourse around debabelization intersects with the history of empire and the aesthetics of modernist and postcolonial literature. PleaseRSVP. (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf09hWYSVMR6XhfCk2C0dQP_fB_M9eio71z_dcL-ZBTZ8yKcQ/viewform)

News & Announcements


** CALL FOR PAPERS: Decolonizing Museums, Collections and Archives in Postcolonial and Indigenous Literatures in English (https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/ariel/announcement/view/528)
------------------------------------------------------------

This special issue of ARIEL  (https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/ariel) examines how postcolonial and Indigenous writers have been writing about museums and collections and how they have been reinventing archival methods. Contemporary literature exposes and displays the museum’s colonial roots, while placing the original processes of alienation, displacement, trauma, and commodification at the centre of knowledge creation. On the one hand, these literary works investigate the museum as it was first conceived, highlighting its limitations and, in some cases, its perduring coloniality. On the other hand, these literary works imagine the future of the museum, restoring Indigenous voices and narratives to the centre of curatorial practices.

We invite articles offering transdisciplinary, diachronic, or comparative perspectives on this topic. Contributors may want to consider literary works through the prism of visual studies, history, or even anthropology, while drawing on museum as well as Indigenous and post/decolonial studies. Authors can consider a wide array of genres (novels, short stories, comics/graphic novels, poetry, theatre). Possible topics of articles may include but are not limited to the following:
* The representation of museums/ collections/ archives in literature: from colonial beginnings to postcolonial critique; figures of the artist/ collector/ curator/ archivist in literature, or the author as a curator/ collector/ archivist.
* Literature as a museum: literature that displays the representations of the Other and contemporary critiques of museums and anthropology; Indigenous literature as an alternative to the colonial museum.
* The literature of display: the ekphrastic dimension of literature; inspiration from objects or texts held and stored in museums or in archives; the reappropriation of art practices in literature.
* A literature of multiple returns: literary depictions of the repatriation of objects, human remains, and stories; commodification, construction of authenticity and remediation.
* Writing Indigenous epistemologies and knowledges: the Indigenous or post/decolonial rewriting of archives and knowledges; Indigenous archives.

Please submit a 300-500 word abstract, together with a short biographical note (no more than 100 words) to the guest editor, Laura Singeot at laura.singeot@gmail.com (mailto:laura.singeot@gmail.com)  by May 1, 2024. Full essays (6000-9000 words) will be due by November 1, 2024.
