Abstract: wâhkôhtowin is a Cree concept that asks us to know our relatives, and like many Indigenous knowledge systems, Cree privileges relationality as an ethical imperative, even in digital spaces. This conversation will consider relationality, in the ways that theft has affected so much of Indigenous cultural transmission, how the adoption of technology, from the horse to TikTok, has always been a component of Indigenous survivance, and the possibilities that Indigenous futurisms offer to articulate how relationality functions in online spaces.

Bio: Jessie is Cree-Métis and a member of Michel First Nation. She is the Anthropology and Indigenous Studies liaison librarian. Her research focuses on building reciprocal research relationships using a nêhiyaw legal perspective and she was a co-lead for building the Riddell Library and Learning Centre.
