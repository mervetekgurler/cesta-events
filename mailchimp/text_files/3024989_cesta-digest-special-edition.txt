** CESTA Digest
Special Edition
------------------------------------------------------------
May 8, 2019
Dear CESTA Colleagues,

In this Special Edition of the CESTA Digest, our team would like to acknowledge and celebrate the extraordinary members of our research community. Last April, CESTA scholars led an enormous array of incredible conferences, workshops, and seminars that discussed their cutting edge research in the Digital Humanities. We'd like to dedicate this Special Digest to all their hard work and share some of their amazing events with you.

Sincerely,
The CESTA Team

The Urban Legacy of Ancient Rome:

Public Release and Exhibit Opening


On April 8th, CESTA hosted its first-ever exhibit opening entitled “The Urban Legacy of Ancient Rome”. Organized by project leads Erik Steiner and James Tice (University of Oregon), the exhibit will run through Spring term and features series of panels highlighting about 2% of the some 5,000 maps, prints, drawings, and photographs that our team prepared for digital preservation from the collections of photographer Ernest Nash (https://exhibits.stanford.edu/nash/)  and archaeologist Rodolfo Lanciani (https://exhibits.stanford.edu/lanciani/)  in collaboration with Italian partners. The work of these two 20th century documentarians comprises one of the most comprehensive collections of contemporary views of ancient Roman structures ever assembled. The April 8th event also featured prints from Giuseppe Vasi on loan from the David Rumsey Map Center. For more information about the exhibit, see here (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/urban-legacy-ancient-rome-project) .

ROSETTA
Workshop on Digital Humanities to Preserve Knowledge and
Cultural Heritage



Organized with the support of the France-Stanford Center for Interdisciplinary Studies, the “Digital Humanities to Preserve Knowledge and Cultural Heritage” workshop (April 15) featured endangered and marginalized traditions and cultures that Digital Humanities have, and will help preserve. Presentations ranged from the technical solutions offered by diverse tools (multilingual editions, translation’s challenges, crowdsourcing as collaboration model) to more specific case studies. The workshop demonstrated how DH can help preserve and map whole cultures (Aztec and Coptic), smaller groups (the Ragusan Republic and the Japanese diaspora in the U.S), cultural and political movements (the Grand Tour tradition, abolitionism), a single author’s environment (James Baldwin) or a single author’s work worldwide (Mark Twain’s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn).

Mapping Ottoman Epirus



On 10 April 2019 CESTA hosted the Mapping Ottoman Epirus (MapOE) preliminary results workshop. MapOE is a project employing digital humanities tools (text mining, network analysis, GIS, deep mapping) in order to inquire into the networks of power of a Tepedelenli Ali pasha, the so-called Muslim Bonaparte, who ruled over western Greece and southern Albania at the turn of the nineteenth century. The research team, composed of Ali Yaycioglu, Antonis Hadjikyriacou, Fatma Öncel, Erik Steiner, and Petros Kastrinakis (in absentia), discussed the challenges of synthesizing Greek and Ottoman sources, elaborated on the methods developed to overcome them, and presented the project's initial outcomes and possibilities for further analysis.

Chinese Railroad Workers Project

On April 11, hundreds of people gathered in Tresidder's Oak Lounge to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad. The event marked a historic rewriting of the 100th anniversary in 1969, when the Chinese railroad workers were famously left out of a speech of recognition. At the 150th, however, the room was packed; event volunteers continued to bring in stacks of extra chairs for the overflowing crowd. Stations around the room displayed research material on historical visualizations, oral history interviews, school curriculum modules, student research, archeology discoveries, digital scholarship, digital materials repository in the Stanford Library, and book releases. Two student researchers, Stephanie Linlin Niu and Preston Carlson, share their perspectives below:
