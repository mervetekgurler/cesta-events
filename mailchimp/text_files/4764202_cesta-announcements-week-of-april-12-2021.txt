Histories and Futures of Linguistic Diversity in DH

Quinn Dombrowski (Stanford University)
Online via Zoom
Register for this talk (https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/quinn-dombrowski-histories-and-futures-of-linguistic-diversity-in-dh-tickets-137766408035)
About this event: International, interdisciplinary spaces are inevitably sites of tension, where differences in linguistic and cultural norms run deeper than they initially appear. Establishing and maintaining a set of norms for a community to operate despite these differences requires ongoing dialogue within that community. This talk will reflect on language as one longstanding axis of diversity within digital humanities as it is carried out at the international level, as well as within different national contexts. This context will inform a frank discussion of the ways in which a general obliviousness towards languages commonly found in Anglophone countries has negatively impacted Anglophone scholars' research, pedagogy, and engagement with the broader field of DH. The talk will conclude with actionable steps that scholars, particularly in Anglophone countries, can take towards embracing language as an important axis of diversity.

Quinn Dombrowski is the Academic Technology Specialist in the Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages, and in the Library, at Stanford University. Prior to coming to Stanford in 2018, Quinn’s many DH adventures included supporting the high-performance computing cluster at UC Berkeley, running the DiRT tool directory with support from the Mellon Foundation, writing books on Drupal for Humanists and University of Chicago library graffiti, and working on the program staff of Project Bamboo, a failed digital humanities cyberinfrastructure initiative.

This is the fifth event in the Digital Humanities Long View, a joint seminar series co-hosted by the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) at Stanford and UCL's Centre for Digital Humanities that explores the history of DH and how this past informs the future of digital humanist methods.
