CESTA's Digital Humanities Fellows Program (https://cesta.stanford.edu/graduate-programs/digital-humanities-fellows-program)  is designed to prepare graduate students for a future where digital scholarship is the norm. This year the program is tailored to advanced graduate students (ABD) and recent PhDs with digital projects that would benefit from integration into a community of scholars and practitioners, participation in curated workshops, and, perhaps most importantly, receive two quarters (up to 150 hours) of dedicated support from an undergraduate research intern.

To foster a community of practice, fellows gather for weekly meetings with their cohort. The program of meetings typically includes:
* Skills workshops
* Seminars from DH practitioners
* Works-in-progress presentations
* Graduate reading group
