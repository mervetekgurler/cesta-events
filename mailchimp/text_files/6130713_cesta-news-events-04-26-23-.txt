Next Week at CESTA


** Know Systemic Racism: Was the police killing of Oscar Grant justified? How do we change the question? (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/know-systemic-racism-was-police-killing-oscar-grant-justified-how-do-we-change-question)
------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday, May 2 | 12:00 -1:15 | Wallenberg 433A

The Know Systemic Racism team has been working on data-driven projects intended to make systemic racism evident. This public humanities work is guided by the intention of "humanizing the harm" of systemic racism.

The team will share three works in progress: an interactive data story of Oscar Grant's life and death within a historical context of discriminatory policies and societal prejudice; a web-based application that makes visible the militarization of California law enforcement; and a project that encourages Stanford Students today to engage with the experience and activism of Black students at Stanford from the past.

Know Systemic Racism is a project of Stanford Libraries led by the inaugural Racial Justice and Social Equity Librarian, Felicia Smith. The projects presented are the work of CESTA interns and Stanford Libraries interns led by digital research architect, Nicole Coleman. KSR and the students work in partnership with the Center for Racial Justice, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Friends Service Committee, and investigative journalists.

This event is cosponsored with the African & African American Studies (AAAS) and the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CCSRE).

The presentation will include lunch and take place at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis in Wallenberg 433A. A Zoom link is available upon request from Center Manager, Jonathan Clark (jclark93@stanford.edu (mailto:jclark93@stanford.edu) ).

News and Announcements

Mellon Sawyer Doctoral Fellowships

CESTA invites applications for two (2) Mellon Sawyer Doctoral Fellowships (http://https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/mellon-sawyer-doctoral-fellowships) to participate in the Sawyer seminar series “The Data that Divide Us: Recalibrating Data Methods for New Knowledge Frameworks Across the Humanities” for the 2023-24 academic year.

Over the course of the year, this Mellon funded Sawyer Seminar will hold a series of 8 interdisciplinary workshops (and 1 day-long symposium) that will analyze how the latency of values involving gender, race, and the medical normal are encoded into existing data sets and the methodologies that we use to analyze them. The seminar will foster a sustained dialogue between local participants and invited speakers on the intersection of data science and the humanities as we explore three key fault lines in our relationship between our research and our data: data before and after the digital divide, the ongoing legacies of nineteenth-century conceptions of data, and the challenges posed by premodern conceptions of scale. Graduate students currently working with CESTA or its constituent labs or projects, or current or former participants in the CESTA Digital Humanities Fellows program are particularly encouraged to apply, but applications from any humanities Stanford graduate student interested in
the seminar topic are welcome. Applicants must hold Terminal Graduate Registration status by the time of appointment (September 2023), and preference will be given to applicants in need of funding with a prospective graduation date of June 2024.

To apply, please send CV and a brief description (500 words) of your dissertation project and previous Digital Humanities work by Monday, May 1st to cesta_stanford@stanford.edu (mailto:cesta_stanford@stanford.edu) .


Mellon Sawyer Postdoctoral Fellowship

CESTA is also seeking applications for a one-year Mellon Sawyer Postdoctoral Fellowship in Digital Humanities. The postdoctoral fellow will play a leading role in organizing, administering and participating in the Mellon Sawyer seminar entitled “The Data that Divides Us: Recalibrating Data Methods for New Knowledge Frameworks Across the Humanities.” We seek recent humanities PhDs whose research operates at the intersection of a relevant data-based field, including, but not limited to, the digital humanities, data science, computational linguistics or social science, or information science. Applications are due May 15th. For more information and to apply, visit the Mellon Sawyer Fellowship webpage (https://postdocs.stanford.edu/prospective/opportunities/open-postdoctoral-position-faculty-mentor-giovanna-ceserani) .

May 4th | 2:00 - 3:00 PM | Wallenberg Hall, 4th floor

All community members are cordially invited to attend our monthly Tea Time, which will be held on the first Thursday of every month. Stop by for coffee, tea, pastry and conversation with colleagues!
