Next Tuesday at CESTA

"Digital Storytelling and Accessibility in the Digital Humanities" (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/anne-ladyem-mcdivitt-digital-storytelling-and-accessibility-digital-humanities)

Anne Ladyem McDivitt
Academic Technology Specialist, Stanford Department of History

Tuesday, November 15 | 12-1.15 PM | Wallenberg 433A and on Zoom (https://stanford.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_9ihlbshzR5KPb8DzGRXXhA)
About this event: Accessibility is an incredibly important topic in digital humanities, but often the scope of what that actually means is limited in academic conversations. Through the lens of utilizing digital storytelling, this talk will reframe the conversation about accessibility of digital humanities to include not only web and resource accessibility, but also equity, learning styles, and barriers to entry for DH.

As part of the CESTA Lunch Seminar Series, this talk will include lunch and take place at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis in Wallenberg 433A. This event is co-sponsored with theDepartment of History (https://history.stanford.edu/) and the Stanford Archaeology Center. (https://archaeology.stanford.edu/)

About this series: Every Tuesday lunchtime (12-1.15 PM) during the academic quarter, CESTA hosts events on topics relevant to the digital humanities. For information about upcoming events in this series, visit our website (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/cesta-seminar-series) .
