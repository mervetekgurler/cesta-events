This Week at CESTA


** CESTA's 2023 DH Research Showcase (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/cesta-digital-humanities-research-showcase-2023)
------------------------------------------------------------
Featuring presentations by:
The Digital Humanities Graduate Fellows &
Undergraduate Research Interns
Friday, May 26 | 8:30 AM - 5:00 PM | Wallenberg 433A

Every year, CESTA's Digital Humanities Fellows Program supports graduate students developing humanities research projects that apply computational tools and methods. Attend this day-long showcase to hear directly from this year's cohort about the projects they pursued through the program. Many will present together with the undergraduate students with whom they collaborated. In the afternoon, in a dedicated poster session, a selection of students from this year's CESTA Undergraduate Research Internship Program (https://cesta.stanford.edu/people/2023-undergraduate-research-interns)  will present their contributions to CESTA faculty research projects.

The showcase will include lunch and refreshments and take place at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis in Wallenberg 433A. Join us for this day of celebration of CESTA research. A Zoom link is available upon request from Center Manager, Jonathan Clark (jclark93@stanford.edu (mailto:jclark93@stanford.edu) ).
