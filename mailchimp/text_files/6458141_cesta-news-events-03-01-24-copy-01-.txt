Applications Now Open: CESTA Undergraduate Research Program Summer Internship (https://cesta.stanford.edu/students/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-research-internship-program)

The Undergraduate Research Internship provides opportunities for undergraduates to work on CESTA affiliated projects full-time during the summer internship program. Through structured research training, experimentation with cutting-edge technologies, and faculty mentorship, students develop valuable academic and professional skill sets. Work on lab projects allows students to apply their developing expertise in data science, GIS, and web development in tandem with humanities skills in critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and ethical decision-making. You can read about the experiences of recent interns in CESTA's 2023 Research Anthology (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cYnaGDLFWsdOEDwJ-hM95XNQqQvhuSZN/view) .

Applications are on a rolling basis. We will start reviewing the initial round of applications on March 15th. All applications are due by midnight (Pacific Standard Time) on Monday, April 1st.For more information, please visit the CESTA webpage.

Debabelization: Language Literature, and Computational Culture  (https://shc.stanford.edu/stanford-humanities-center/events/aarthi-vadde-debabelization-language-literature-and-computational)
with Aarthi Vadde

Tuesday, March 12 | 5:30 - 7:00 PM | Stanford Humanities Center, Board Room

“Debabelization,” as linguist C.K. Ogden put it in 1931, motivated rich debates about whether technological intervention could make particular languages more efficient agents of cultural exchange. Aarthi Vadde, Associate Professor of English at Duke University, will consider how the competitive and techno-utopian discourse around debabelization intersects with the history of empire and the aesthetics of modernist and postcolonial literature. PleaseRSVP. (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf09hWYSVMR6XhfCk2C0dQP_fB_M9eio71z_dcL-ZBTZ8yKcQ/viewform)

Call For Papers: Code as Conversation (http://www.cdh.cam.ac.uk/events/37778/)
Saturday 1 June 2024, University of Cambridge (in-person)

This one-day conference on the dynamic field of critical code studies will expand on the conversations begun by the Cultural Politics of Code (https://www.cdh.cam.ac.uk/research/readinggroups/criticalcode/)  reading group at Cambridge. The keynote will be delivered by David Berry (https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p125219-david-berry) , Professor of Digital Humanities at the University of Sussex. The committee welcome submissions of code readings, critiques, papers, and explorations that engage with code as a phenomenon that is simultaneously communicative and functional. We would be particularly excited to read contributions from those on the margins of critical code studies: both humanities practitioners new to the interpretation of code, and those from STEM disciplines interested in humanities analysis. We hope that this will lead to a day of conversation that is authentically cross-disciplinary and productive of new approaches to critical code studies.

Potential topics include, but are not limited to:
* Code comments and collaborations between development teams and users.
* Close readings of code that adopt the critical vocabulary of e.g. literature, anthropology, cultural studies
* Communication between different coding languages, compilers, and hardware.
* Translation and collaboration between different historic encoding systems (e.g. shorthand, cryptography, musical notation, telegraph codes).
* Incommensurabilities of language between code and critique
* The social world of code/code as a social phenomenon
* Code remediations and intermediations (e.g. code poetry, API work)
* Relations of authorship and readership as they apply to code
* Conversation and collaboration as tools for critiquing (as well as building) code
* The position of the platform in code conversation
