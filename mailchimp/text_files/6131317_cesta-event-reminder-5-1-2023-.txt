** Know Systemic Racism: Was the police killing of Oscar Grant justified? How do we change the question? (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/know-systemic-racism-was-police-killing-oscar-grant-justified-how-do-we-change-question)
------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday, May 2 | 12:00 -1:15 | Wallenberg 433A

The Know Systemic Racism team has been working on data-driven projects intended to make systemic racism evident. This public humanities work is guided by the intention of "humanizing the harm" of systemic racism.

The team will share three works in progress: an interactive data story of Oscar Grant's life and death within a historical context of discriminatory policies and societal prejudice; a web-based application that makes visible the militarization of California law enforcement; and a project that encourages Stanford Students today to engage with the experience and activism of Black students at Stanford from the past.

Know Systemic Racism is a project of Stanford Libraries led by the inaugural Racial Justice and Social Equity Librarian, Felicia Smith. The projects presented are the work of CESTA interns and Stanford Libraries interns led by digital research architect, Nicole Coleman. KSR and the students work in partnership with the Center for Racial Justice, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Friends Service Committee, and investigative journalists.

This event is cosponsored with the African & African American Studies (AAAS) and the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CCSRE).

The presentation will include lunch and take place at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis in Wallenberg 433A. A Zoom link is available upon request from Center Manager, Jonathan Clark (jclark93@stanford.edu (mailto:jclark93@stanford.edu) ).
