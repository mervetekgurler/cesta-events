Critical Data Practices Workshop
Wednesday, May 4, 2022. 5:30-7:00PM PT.
Workshop: The Spatial Dimension of Data
Hybrid event. Registration (in-person and online) and Zoom link (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKuqmt1X93Br4R8irHUZxaoUrD6fL-XD2BCfgiyXPdK6i_vA/viewform) .

Whether it comes from the real world or the fictional, humanistic data nearly always has a spatial component, whether we call that “location”, “source”, “setting.” Often, though, space is either the focus of inquiry, or an afterthought, if not left out altogether. Digital tools offer a wide variety of possibilities for working with spatial data, from mapping and visualization to more complex forms of spatial analysis. How can we take advantage of these methods and possibilities to better capture the spatial aspect of our data, and what can scholars of the spatial show us that we might be missing in our present work?

Transnational Digital Humanities in the Digital Black Atlantic
Roopika Risam
Online, via Zoom. Register here. (https://stanford.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_w8R3zm0SS66KpJ9WHHCQ-A)

About this talk: How do we reconcile transnationalism in the context of digital humanities? In what ways does transnationality risk perpetuating inequalities in digital knowledge production? In this talk, Roopika Risam will discuss her work co-editing The Digital Black Atlantic with Kelly Baker Josephs, as well as her work on the Pan-Africanism Data Project, to explore the fraught nature of transnational discourses and practices in digital humanities.

About the speaker: Roopika Risam is Chair of Secondary and Higher Education and Associate Professor of Education and English at Salem State University. She is the author of New Digital Worlds: Postcolonial Digital Humanities in Theory, Praxis, and Pedagogy (Northwestern University Press, 2018) and co-editor of The Digital Black Atlantic (University of Minnesota Press, 2021). Risam also co-edits the journal Reviews in Digital Humanities, which offers peer review of digital scholarly outputs. Risam is the Principal Investigator of the Digital Ethnic Futures Consortium, an initiative supported by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to build capacity for teaching at the intersections of digital humanities and ethnic studies. Her current book project, “Insurgent Academics: A Radical Account of Public Humanities,” traces a new history of public humanities through the emergence of ethnic studies.

Reframing Enslaved Pasts
History of Slavery and Material Culture: Can Objects Help Us Understanding the Lives of Enslaved People?
Online via Zoom. Open to all. Register here (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcude6uqjwoEtViRoXX-f552smtfJBndtq4) .
The “Reframing enslaved pasts (https://sgs.stanford.edu/news-eventsevents/global-research-workshops) ” series discusses critical data practices around enslaved pasts, focusing on the methods and choices that underlie digital data projects.

About the talk: This talk will explore how the study of material culture can contribute to understanding the history of the Atlantic slave trade and slavery and the lives of enslaved people. Although there is no specific digital repository focusing on the material culture of slavery, this talk will point to existing collections that could contribute to the creation of such a database. Ultimately I will argue that depending on the approach objects can illuminate our understanding of lives of enslaved people and provide opportunities to establish connections between the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean systems.

Mapping the Aegean: Cristoforo Buondelmonti’s Liber Insularum and the Birth of Classical Archaeology
Benedetta Bessi
Hybrid format: online and in-person.
Building 110, Room 112, or on Zoom (https://stanford.zoom.us/j/92713288408?pwd=WkVMbllIYzExd3QwbnBaNXRwNWF4UT09#success) .
Lunch provided after the talk.

The Liber Insularum Archipelagi (1420) by the Florentine traveler Cristoforo Buondelmonti can be considered the first guide to the Greek islands, each of them described by a textual paragraph and illustrated by colour maps, in a format which gave rise to the new literary genre of Isolaria and enjoyed great popularity between the 15th and the 16th century in Italy and Europe. This talk discusses the Liber Insularum in the frame of its Humanistic background while highlightening the fundamental role that this work had in opening the path to the rediscovery of Greece, not only as a literary topos suspended in an atemporal dimension but also as a concrete geographical space with a long history and rich cultural heritage. Differently from previous scholarship which limited itself to extrapolate isolated passages of the Liber for the sake of studying single islands or, even worst, dismissed this work to the rank of medieval mirabilia, I argue that Cristoforo Buondelmonti and his Liber Insularum,
are to be credited with a groundbreaking role in the exploration of Greece and the birth of Greek archaeology. In the course of the lecture, I will also illustrate the combination of traditional and digital methods used to support such claims.

Benedetta Bessi is a Classical archaeologist interested in the cultural history of the ancient Mediterranean, history of archaeology and digital humanities. She has conducted fieldwork and research in Italy, Greece, Syria and Libya and has travelled extensively to North Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East acquiring first-hand familiarity with archaeological sites, museums and the cultural heritage of these areas. She holds a B.A. in Classics from the University of Florence (with one year at the Ludwig-Maximilians Universität in Munich), a postgraduate specialization degree in Classical Archaeology from the Italian Archaeological School of Athens (SAIA), a PhD in Greek and Roman Archaeology and History of Art from the University of Messina and a three-year diploma in Arabic language and Arabic culture from the Italian Institute for Africa and the Orient (ISIAO). She was Mary Seeger O'Boyle Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Program in Hellenic Studies at Princeton and
Alexander Onassis research fellow at the National Hellenic Research Foundation in Athens. She has taught courses in Classics and Classical Archaeology at many American institutions in Rome including John Cabot University and Temple Rome Program and she has been featured in documentaries and TV shows on History Channel, National Geographic and Netflix. As the recipient of the European Community Marie Sklodowska-Curie Research Fellowship, she is now working on the project “Mapping the Aegean: Cristoforo Buondelmonti's Liber insularum (15th c.) and the Origins of Classical Archaeology” https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/894231.
