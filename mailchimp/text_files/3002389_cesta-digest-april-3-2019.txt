More Info at Explore Courses (https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=English+104&collapse=)

Join this course to reconsider the literary text as a physical object, tracing how writers integrate its material characteristics into their poetry and prose during eras of increasing mechanization. How do these texts ask us to “read” the printed page? When and why do we ignore it? How does literature engage our senses and call attention to itself?


** The Chinese Deathscape: Out on Stanford University Press

The Chinese Deathscape: Grave Reform in Modern China, an online monograph edited by CESTA Faculty Thomas S. Mullaney, has been published by Stanford University Press. The project features work by Christian Henriot, Jeff Snyder-Reinke, David McClure, and Glen Worthey. Congratulations on this great work!
