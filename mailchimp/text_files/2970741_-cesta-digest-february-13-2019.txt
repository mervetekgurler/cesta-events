CESTA Researchers In the News
Unique to Stanford: Digital humanities bridges technology and humanities (The Stanford Daily, Michelle Leung, February 1 2019).  (https://www.stanforddaily.com/2019/02/01/unique-to-stanford-digital-humanities-bridges-technology-and-humanities/)

"Stanford’s digital humanities minor aims to integrate research into academics by offering undergraduates the opportunity to apply computational and digital tools to their pursuits in the humanities. Part of the program’s inspiration came from undergraduate work at the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA), Stanford’s international digital humanities center on the top floor of Wallenberg Hall."
