Fantastic Futures: 2nd Int'l Conference on AI for Libraries, Museums, and Archives
December 4-6, 2019 | Register Now (https://library.stanford.edu/projects/fantastic-futures)
What role will libraries, archives, and museums play, as trusted sources of information, when more and more of the information we consume is algorithmically generated? How will the values of neutrality, privacy, authority, and preservation that these institutions advance help shape AI. How will our institutions adapt these values to a changing landscape? How can we put AI to work for us, to transform and elevate our services beyond 20th century modalities? Hosted by Stanford Libraries and the National Library of Norway.

Our colleague and collaborator, Dr. Katie McDonough (now at the Alan Turing Institute), will return to Stanford to present at this conference. We'll also have Katie talk about the Living with Machines project (http://livingwithmachines.ac.uk/latest/)  at CESTA on Tuesday, December 2 - more details coming soon!
