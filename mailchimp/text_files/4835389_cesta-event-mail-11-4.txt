Critical Data Practices Workshop

Outliers: The Unusual and The Regular
Hybrid format. Register here (https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZ4-irytWJSxGLDubl74UbeCQ7oeroADrGPj_3DbSfwTiWrQ/viewform?usp=send_form) .

Presenters: Alison McQueen (Assistant Professor of Political Science), Giovanna Ceserani (Associate Professor of Classics), Nick Gardner (PhD Candidate, Classics), and Maciej Kurzynski (PhD Candidate, East Asian Languages & Cultures)

About this workshop: One of the disciplinary differences that has surfaced in our turn to computation is the question of what we do about outliers. For fields that are interested in means, averages and majorities, outliers potentially represent noise within the data. For fields that primarily study individual works or people, outliers are often the subject of study themselves, whether because they are exemplary or simply because they are unusual. And for fields whose data is fragmented by time or access, simply differentiating outliers within a sample can be a challenge. How do we handle the appearance of outliers in our data? Do we use them to drive our attention or discard them as unrepresentative of our sample? Have computational methods changed our disciplinary approaches to bring our work closer together, or have they pushed us farther apart?
The Critical Data Practices Workshop Series explores the unique challenges that face the arts and humanities as we ground data-driven insights in real-world human complexity, and in various social, cultural, and historical contexts. Digitization and computational methods provide new opportunities for understanding the cultural implications of data, its meaning, and its significance to the long history of recorded human experience. We must therefore carefully consider the ways that we derive meaning from data through critical attention to methods and sources. The workshop gives particular attention to what the humanities have to say to data practices in the current moment and urges us to critically examine the issues of representation, equity, accessibility, and discoverability.
Calling all undergraduates!

AI Seed Grant Awarded to CESTA Affiliates

Congratulations to CESTA Faculty Board Member Mark Algee-Hewitt and former CESTA Director Elaine Treharne! Together with their collaborators in the departments of Religious Studies, Music, Art and Art History, Communication, and Civil and Environmental Engineering, they have been awarded a seed grant by Human-Centered AI (HAI) (https://hai.stanford.edu/news/stanford-hai-awards-25-million-new-ai-research) for their new project: the Humanities AI Network (HUMAIN).

HUMAIN is a collaboratory dedicated to problem-solving through humanistic research using AI methods. Look out for the workshops HUMAIN will host in 2022: ‘Lost and Found: Discoverability and Surveillance’, and ‘Bodies of Records: the Aesthetics of Archives and AI’.
