Re-Formations: Visualizing Complex Concept Spaces in the Eighteenth Century
Mark Algee-Hewitt
Hybrid event: in-person at CESTA and via Zoom. Register for Zoom attendance here. (https://stanford.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_ntkTmos_QCuyjjh6fZIpog)

About this Talk: The eighteenth century was a rich period for the emergence of ideas that we continue to grapple with today. Contemporary ideas such as “political justice,” or “human rights,” not only appeared in the conceptual framework of eighteenth-century political, social, or philosophical theory, but the terms themselves also became part of the cultural lexicon. These compound concepts, in which two pre-existing terms are brought together into a new configuration with a single, stable meaning, form a critical backbone of eighteenth-century thought. In this project, I have trained a set of aligned vector models to trace the ways in which these kinds of concepts emerged within the eighteenth century. Using a new visualization that shows the changing relationships between the constituent parts of complex concepts over time, I focus the lens of this new tool on the concept of political revolution. With this method, I explore how the various changes in the discourse of revolution over the
course of the eighteenth century set the stage for the political upheavals of the American and French Revolutions at the century’s close.

About the Speaker: Mark Algee-Hewitt’s research focuses on the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in England and Germany and seeks to combine literary criticism with digital and quantitative analyses of literary texts. In particular he is interested in the history of aesthetic theory and the development and transmission of aesthetic and philosophic concepts during the Enlightenment and Romantic periods. He is also interested in the relationship between aesthetic theory and the poetry of the long eighteenth century.  Although his primary background is in English literature, he also has a degree in computer science. As the director of the Stanford Literary Lab, he is working to bring his interests in quantitative analysis, digital humanities and eighteenth-century literature to bear on a number of new collaborative projects. His forthcoming book, The Afterlife of the Sublime, explores the history of the sublime by tracing its discursive patterns through over 11,000 texts from the long
eighteenth century, seeking clues to the disappearance of the term at the end of the Romantic period. As a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at McGill University, working with the Interacting with Print Research group, Dr. Algee-Hewitt was also involved in a variety of projects that combine literary interpretation with quantitative analysis. He is a co-coordinator of the Book History BiblioGraph, a new dynamic online resource and recommendation engine that visualizes connections between contemporary resources on Book History using statistical methods.
Critical Data Practices
Friday, April 29, 2022. 9:00-10:00PM PT.
The Problem of Missing Data
In collaboration with the School for Advanced Study
Online event. Registration and Zoom link (https://forms.gle/ZPicmJttqcD7pYYP8) .
Can the quantity of data ever make up for its quality? What can we do about data that is necessarily incomplete, or where the incompleteness of the data is precisely what gives it its scholarly interest? How do we engage with vast quantities of data without losing sight of what’s been excluded—systemically, deliberately, or by happenstance—from the archive?

Chair: Jane Winters (Professor, Digital Humanities) Discussants: Caio Mello (Doctoral Researcher, Digital Humanities), Amara Thornton (Co-Investigator and Research Fellow, Classics), Anna-Maria Sichani (Post-Doctoral Research Associate, Digital Humanities), Naomi Wells (Lecturer, Modern Languages and Digital Humanities).
Wednesday, May 4, 2022. 5:30-7:00PM PT.
Workshop: The Spatial Dimension of Data
Hybrid event. Registration (in-person and online) and Zoom link (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKuqmt1X93Br4R8irHUZxaoUrD6fL-XD2BCfgiyXPdK6i_vA/viewform) .
Whether it comes from the real world or the fictional, humanistic data nearly always has a spatial component, whether we call that “location”, “source”, “setting.” Often, though, space is either the focus of inquiry, or an afterthought, if not left out altogether. Digital tools offer a wide variety of possibilities for working with spatial data, from mapping and visualization to more complex forms of spatial analysis. How can we take advantage of these methods and possibilities to better capture the spatial aspect of our data, and what can scholars of the spatial show us that we might be missing in our present work?

Thursday, June 2 - Friday, June 3
Critical Data Practices Symposium
In-person event. Registration details to follow.
For some humanistic disciplines, data is nothing new; for others, conceiving of the material of study as “data” might entail significant shifts of thought. For all kinds of humanistic data, however, digital tools offer powerful new modes of inquiry, enabling us to work at new scales and on new kinds of material. But digital methods offer new challenges, too, asking us to confront what data might become in the contexts of the humanities and to consider the ethics of its collection, storage, and use. And, we must constantly face the challenge of integrating these methods into the practices of the humanities so that we do not abandon hard-won “analogue” expertise in the hasty pursuit of the latest computational methods.

Critical Data Practices has been considering these issues in our regular workshops this year. In this symposium we will be drawing into our conversation scholars and experts—faculty, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars—from our neighboring institutions up and down the Californian coast. Together, we will synthesize and elaborate what our workshops have already discussed on topics such as missing data, outliers versus averages, the futurity and archiving of data and methods, the affordances and difficulties of pre-modern data, strategies for communicating technical results, and the spatial element inherent to data.

Discussants will include: David Bamman (Berkeley), Sean Fraga (USC), Rachael King (UC Santa Barbara), Marit MacArthur (UC Davis)
