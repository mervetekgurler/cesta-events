Challenging 19th Century Data Legacies:  Jo Guldi and Erik Fredner  (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/mellon-sawyer-seminar-series-challenging-19th-century-data-legacies-jo-guldi-erik-fredner)

Thursday, February 8 | 5:30 - 7:00 PM | Wallenberg Hall, Room 433A

From the differentiation of gendered labor (and of gender itself), to the biological arguments for race-based thinking, to the codification of measures and mapping for land ownership and economic development, the statistical imagination of the west in the nineteenth century created the conditions of social classification whose ramifications we are still dealing with today.

This workshop begins the hard task of unpacking this late nineteenth-century nexus, challenging in particular its data legacies. What conditions underwrote these codifications of race, gender, and development? What do they tell us about the prehistory of data in the centuries before, and what are the consequences of that transformation today?

Erik Fredner's and Jo Guldi's work in the digital humanities deconstructs the conditions of possibility for, and future ramifications of, this nineteenth-century turn towards data, while aiding the recovery of alternate forms of information design that may help us realize the multi-valent possibilities of data outside of its original narrow historical channels. Please join us for a conversation about past, present, and future possibilities for data.

If you cannot attend the event in person, you can register for the Zoom link here (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAsdOqhrzorG9HE-s3pp2mJJZOK6tVs2iBa) . Preceding the seminar, there will be a reception with light refreshments beginning at 5 pm.

Please join us for an informal methods-based conversation with our esteemed guest, Professor Jo Guldi, a leader in the fields of Natural Language Processing and text mining. All are welcome! If you have any questions, please reach out to cesta_stanford@stanford.edu.
Jo Guldi is professor of Quantitative Methods at Emory University. A data scientist, writer, and historian, she has written about such subjects as the responsible use of Artificial Intelligence, the history and politics of global land use, the origins of state-built infrastructure, the use of data for environmental governance, and quantitative approaches to the text-based archives of the past. She has been a fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows and the University of Chicago. Her research has appeared in the Atlantic, the Boston Review, the Guardian, Huffington Post, Counterpunch, and Alternet.

News & Announcements

Meet our Winter & Spring Undergraduate Research Interns! (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/introducing-cestas-2024-winter-spring-undergraduate-research-interns)

Introducing our Winter and Spring 2024 Undergraduate Research Interns, a community of digital humanities researchers.

The Center for Textual and Spatial Analysis at Stanford runs undergraduate research internship programs in the winter, spring, and summer quarters.  Our undergraduate interns contribute to projects led by Stanford faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars, while acquiring new skills through workshops and activities designed for the internship program. Our interns continue to advance digital humanities research and create a unique community of researchers at Wallenberg Hall. You can read below about our current cohort of interns and their work. This year's fully in-person program is supported by the program director and the graduate mentor:  Dr. Chloe Summers Edmondson (https://cesta.stanford.edu/people/chloe-edmondson-0) , long-time affiliate with CESTA and Acting Assistant Professor in the French and Italian Department at Stanford, and JJ Lugardo (https://classics.stanford.edu/people/jj-lugardo) , PhD student in Classics.

We’re grateful to the many campus partners who support our research and programs, including colleagues at Stanford University Libraries and the Stanford Humanities Center.  Our Undergraduate Research Internship program receives generous support from a VPUE Departmental Grant. Some projects and interns at CESTA are also supported by Changing Human Experience Grants, departmental funds, and faculty research funds. Learn more about this year's interns and their projects here! (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/introducing-cestas-2024-winter-spring-undergraduate-research-interns)

Introducing the Sawyer Graduate Reading Group

Happy New Year, digital-enthusiast humanists of Stanford!
The Sawyer Graduate Reading Group is convening in the Winter and Fall to discuss applications of “The Data that Divide Us.” Our programming compliments the Mellon Sawyer Seminar (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/stanford-receives-major-mellon-foundation-award-be-hosted-center-spatial-and-textual-analysis?search=mellon+sawyer)  offerings, with a focus on bringing graduate students in the humanities into the conversation.

In Winter, we will discuss the work of two Stanford researchers: Quinn Dombrowski and Anne Ladyem McDivitt. Quinn’s work focuses on multilingual computational text analysis. Anne Ladyem is a historian with a focus on digital and public history. After reading and discussing their work, the data they use, the challenges it presents, and the methods they use to overcome those challenges, we will meet with Quinn and Anne Ladyem to ask questions and hear firsthand their perspectives and experiences on the management of textual and geospatial data, and the broader use of data in humanistic research.

In the Spring, we will turn to the research of the Sawyer Seminar's invited speakers (Dagomar Degroot, Jessica Otis, Greg O'Malley, Alex Borucki, Lauren Klein), again focusing on the theoretical issues engendered by these scholars' data sources and the practical methods that these researchers avail themselves of in their approach to data.

All Stanford Humanities graduates are welcome! Mark your calendars for January 16, January 23, February 13, February 20, April 2, April 16, and May 7. These are all Tuesdays, and meetings will take place between 12:00-1:15. Wallenberg 434. Lunch will be provided.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Your Mellon Sawyer Dissertation Fellows,

Chloé Brault (PhD Candidate in Comparative Literature) and
Matt Warner (PhD Candidate in English)

Rachel Midura Leads Research Group Mapping Early Modern Travel (https://news.vt.edu/articles/2024/01/clahs-premoderntravel.html)

Rachel Midura, Assistant Professor of Digital History at Virginia Tech, and longtime CESTA collaborator, is leading a research group that seeks to understand the routes that Early Modern travelers took. through the digital analysis of textual travel itineraries. This work is supported by a Digital Humanities Advancement Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Congratulations, Rachel! Read more about this exciting project here.
