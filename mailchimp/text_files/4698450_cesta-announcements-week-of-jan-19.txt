CFP: Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) 2021 Virtual Conference

ACH,  the US-based professional organization for digital humanities, (https://ach.org/)  is hosting a virtual conference on July 22-23, 2020. If you’re interested in presenting your work, there are multiple format options, including lighting talks and posters which are particularly good for in-development projects. ACH has a reputation for being one of the most welcoming and friendly DH conferences, particularly for those new to digital humanities. Information about the conference is available here (https://ach.org/blog/2020/12/29/call-for-proposals-association-for-computers-and-the-humanities-2021/) . If you’ve never written a DH conference proposal, check out this guide. (https://digitalhumanities.stanford.edu/guide-writing-dh-conference-submissions)
CIDR (https://library.stanford.edu/research/cidr) developers and humanities ATSes are happy to take a look at your proposal and give you feedback before you submit it! The conference submission deadline is February 1, but please send your draft to contact-cidr@stanford.edu (mailto:contact-cidr@stanford.edu) no later than January 27.
