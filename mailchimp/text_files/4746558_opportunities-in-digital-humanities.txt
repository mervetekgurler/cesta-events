The Stanford Humanities Center invites faculty, advanced graduate students, and scholars from across Stanford University's schools, institutes, centers, and organizations to propose a research theme to pursue during the 2021-2022 academic year. Each year these endowed workshops offer a unique space in which to initiate, advance, and develop emerging research agendas.

We encourage research themes that test interdisciplinary and institutional boundaries and engage scholars in collaborations to create new constructs for humanities research. Workshop meetings may be organized as lectures, conferences, or symposia. This year's workshops embraced the pandemic's uncertainties by leveraging technology to expand and enrich intellectual collaboration with scholars and institutions across the globe.
