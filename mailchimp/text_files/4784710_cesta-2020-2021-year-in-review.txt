Dear CESTA friends,

The rhythms of summer have set in. At CESTA we continue to adjust, but now amid much more hopeful signs. Though we are still operating remotely, the campus is reviving with the presence of more than a thousand undergraduates, including hundreds of first-year students experiencing residential Stanford for the first time while enrolled for the summer quarter.

It’s a pleasure to introduce the participants in our summer programs, which are now in full swing. Please meet the 2021 Summer Undergraduate Research Interns (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/introducing-our-summer-2021-interns) , working hard on 13 projects, and our current graduate mentors, Merve Tekgürler (https://history.stanford.edu/people/merve-tekgurler)  (from History) and Annie Lamar (https://classics.stanford.edu/people/annie-lamar)  (from Classics). We also welcome the inaugural cohort of a pilot collaboration with Foothill Community College, launched with a grant from the Office of Community Engagement (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/cesta-receives-grant-office-community-engagement-new-partnership-foothill-college) . Individual CESTA projects, meanwhile, continue their work. On July 8 the Modernist Archives Publishing Project, led by Alice Staveley, will host a round table on "Transatlantic Modernist Publishing"
(https://www.modernistarchives.com/content/transatlantic-modernist-publishing-july-8) at 8 am PST. We admire the resilience and adaptability of everyone involved, which is helping this remote summer to be as vivacious as ever.

As we look forward to seeing everyone again this fall, it seems fitting to take stock of this past year--to keep in mind what everyone has been through, to reflect on what many have lost, and to linger appreciatively on the extraordinary exertions and resilience that these past sixteen months have required. In witness of the work done thanks to CESTA’s brilliant staff and community of students and faculty, please find below a year in review.

In gratitude,

Giovanna Ceserani

The Year in CESTA Events
Data Practices Online Conference and Challenge

At the start of the first fully remote academic quarter, Cesta, in partnership with Stanford’s Libraries and Data Science Institute, organized a conference on Data Practices bringing virtually to our community three exciting speakers, Anne Burdick (professor of visual communication at UTS), Jo Guildi (professor of history and digital history at SMU) and Mark Hansen (professor of computational journalism at Columbia University), to discuss how data science, digital humanities, and libraries address sources, methods, and meaning. These questions were also addressed during the conference’s ‘challenge’ through active teamwork by data science and digital humanities students. You can read more about this event and watch recordings of the keynote speakers here (https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/datapractices/home) .


Digital Humanities Public Lectures
This year CESTA inaugurated its Digital Humanities Public Lecture series with public talks by Gordon Chang and Roland Hsu (on November 17, 2020) and by Elaine Treharne (on March 9, 2021). These talks, which were attended by hundreds of people from around the world, marked a new and ongoing effort by CESTA to bring faculty research in DH to the general public.
"The Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project," with Prof. Gordon Chang and Dr. Roland Hsu
"Near and Far: Medieval Manuscripts Through Digital Time and Space," with Prof. Elaine Treharne
Critical Data Practices Workshop
Giovanna Ceserani, Elaine Treharne, Nicole Coleman, and Merve Tekgürler coordinated the Critical Data Practices workshop (https://critical-data-practices.netlify.app)  (sponsored by the Stanford Humanities Center (https://shc.stanford.edu/workshops/current-workshops) ). In eight sessions over the course of the academic year, the workshop encouraged participants (faculty, staff, and graduate students) to investigate the ways data extracted from cultural artifacts, writings, and observations can be transformed into new knowledge that positively impacts scholarly understanding of the human in the machine.

Digital Humanities Long View
CESTA also collaborated with University College London's Centre for Digital Humanities in organizing the Digital Humanities Long View (https://cestastanford.github.io) seminar series, which has brought together speakers from across the world to discuss where digital humanities research has been and where it's going. The last and tenth talk for this year was Mark Algee-Hewitt's "Laboratory Life in the Humanities: Computation, Criticism, and Collaboration." You can access recordings of talks in the series here (https://cestastanford.github.io/schedule.html) .

CESTA Seminar Series
CESTA's long-running Seminar Series continued this year with nine talks on subjects ranging from "Distant Reading the Law" (Dr. Hanjo Hamann) to "Geographical Knowledge in the Ottoman World" (Dr. Adrien Zakar, Merve Tekgürler, and Umar Patel). You can view many of these talks on CESTA's website (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/recorded-talks)  or on our YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCok8JHwa7L9XR1FN6bftGyw) .

Student Programs

Undergraduate Research Internship
Notwithstanding the difficulties of doing research remotely, CESTA continued its Undergraduate Research Internship throughout the academic year, supporting 119 undergraduate students in collaborations on 26 faculty projects. You can learn more about the talented students pushing digital humanities research forward at CESTA here (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/introducing-our-winter-2021-interns) and here (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/introducing-our-spring-2021-interns) . The program is continuing this summer quarter, with 21 students working on 13 DH research projects (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/introducing-our-summer-2021-interns) . You will be able to read about this year's research in the 2020-2021 CESTA Research Anthology, which will come out this fall. In the meantime, please take a look at the 2019-2020 Anthology (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/cesta-summer-2020-research-anthology-online) , designed by interns Krain Chen and Lily Nilipour.

Digital Humanities Graduate Fellowship
CESTA's Digital Humanities Graduate Fellowship (https://cesta.stanford.edu/dhgf) , led this year by Daniel Bush and Senior Fellow Anna Toledano, grew to 12 students from nine departments, its largest cohort ever. Five graduate fellows collaborated with undergraduate interns as part of the fellowship, and their joint presentations at CESTA's end-of-the-year Research Symposium (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/digital-humanities-research-symposium) testify to the quality of the work they did together. You can learn more about this year's fellows and their DH projects here (https://cesta.stanford.edu/digital-humanities-graduate-fellows-2020-2021) .
