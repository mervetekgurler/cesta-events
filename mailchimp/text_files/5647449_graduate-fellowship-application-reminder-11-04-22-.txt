Applications for CESTA's 2022-2023 Digital Humanities Graduate Fellowship (https://cesta.stanford.edu/graduate-programs/digital-humanities-graduate-fellowship) close in one week! We invite applications from any graduate student or post-doc in a humanities or humanistic social science discipline who would like support to advance their research through the use of digital methods.
About CESTA: CESTA (https://cesta.stanford.edu/) is Stanford's center for the digital humanities, where Stanford faculty and students cultivate research at the intersection of computing, design and the humanities. CESTA projects (https://cesta.stanford.edu/research/projects) explore a huge variety of humanities research topics and employ a wide array of computational methodologies.

About the Fellowship Program: The Digital Humanities Graduate Fellowship (https://cesta.stanford.edu/graduate-programs/digital-humanities-graduate-fellowship) is designed to prepare students for a future where digital scholarship is the norm. Over Winter and Spring quarter 2023, fellows will develop their skills, learn from one another, and produce a piece of publishable scholarship, such as a journal article or dissertation chapter, which makes use of digital methods or approaches. The support of an undergraduate research assistant is offered to each fellow. Stanford graduate students and post-docs working in any humanities or humanistic social science discipline are eligible to apply. Take a look at the projects of previous fellows here (https://cesta.stanford.edu/graduate-programs/alumni) .
What support do CESTA Graduate Fellows receive?
As a Digital Humanities Graduate Fellow, you will receive training and support to conduct an individual research project in the digital humanities. This includes 80 hours of research assistance from an undergraduate research intern or $1500 in funding for  conferences, workshops or research expenses. Fellows also participate in a lively community of researchers and will meet and learn from experts in various digital humanities subfields.
How do I apply?

Application is via an online form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddIBn6zzHUXAyZJlVukzJS0Z_Lrtt2kKlQf67nt6gA7DasCg/viewform)  consisting of three parts:
* basic information about you, your department or center, and your stage in your program;
* short answer questions about your current research and the research idea that you would like to work on during the fellowship program (this idea does not need to be fully worked out at the application stage and need not be a part of your dissertation project/post-doctoral research project);
* a CV upload.
