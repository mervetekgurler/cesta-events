“Digital Rasanblaj: Disassembling the Haitian Archive”
Prof. Marlene Daut, University of Virginia

Tuesday, January 12
12 pm to 1 pm
Register for the Zoom webinar (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAvd--rrTkjGtbFLRVVDz_8BYeU2iRthrME )

About this event: Interrogating approaches to the archives of Haiti, whose history is a critical but often forgotten part of the story of the making of the modern world-system, this talk asks the fundamental question:

What does it mean to engage in digital archiving not for the purposes of constituting historical authority, but for the purposes of community story-telling?

About the speaker: Marlene L. Daut specializes in Caribbean, African American, and French colonial literary and historical studies. Her first book, Tropics of Haiti: Race and the Literary History of the Haitian Revolution in the Atlantic World, 1789-1865, was published in 2015 by Liverpool University Press' Series in the Study of International Slavery. Her second book, Baron de Vastey and the Origins of Black Atlantic Humanism, was published in fall 2017 from Palgrave Macmillan’s series in the New Urban Atlantic. A collaborative project entitled, Haitian Revolutionary Fictions: An Anthology, is forthcoming in October 2021 with the University of Virginia Press. Daut is the co-creator and co-editor of H-Net Commons’ digital platform, H-Haiti (https://networks.h-net.org/h-haiti) . She also curates a website on early Haitian print culture at http://lagazetteroyale.com (http://lagazetteroyale.com/)  and has developed an online bibliography of fictions of the Haitian Revolution from 1787 to 1900
