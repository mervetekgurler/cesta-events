October 28 | 9 AM - 12 PM | Wallenberg Hall Rm 433A
About this event: This workshop introduces the practice of digital text annotation with CATMA (https://catma.de/)  (Computer Assisted Text Markup and Analysis). CATMA is an annotation tool specifically designed for humanities research practice. The software can be used to manage multiple projects that combine documents, annotation categories, and team members. At the core of the software is the annotation area, where texts can be annotated either with predefined categories or according to heuristics developed during the research process. All annotations and comments can then be analyzed, visualized and quantitatively evaluated.

The 3-hours workshop includes:
1. Introduction to methods of text annotation and the CATMA software
2. Demonstration of the following features of CATMA: set up projects, create tagsets (category systems for annotations), annotate, analyze and visualize the annotations
3. Practical exercises: Formulation of own research questions, creation of tagsets and text annotations, analysis and interpretation of the annotations

Learning objectives of the workshop:
* Attendees will learn three methods of annotation: (1) manual-analog, (2) manual-digital, (3) collaborative manual-digital annotation.
* Attendees will be able to reflect on the usefulness of text annotation and learn to decide how to apply it most appropriately in order to approach a chosen research question.
* Attendees will be able to formulate research questions and approach the answering of these questions with the help of text annotation.

No previous technical knowledge is necessary for the workshop. To actively participate in the workshop, a laptop (tablet unfortunately not compatible) with a working internet connection is required. Cookies and coffee will be available.
