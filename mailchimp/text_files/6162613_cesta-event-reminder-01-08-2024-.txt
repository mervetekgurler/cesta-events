What Social Network Analysis Can Tell Us About German Humanism (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/amy-nelson-burnett-what-social-network-analysis-can-tell-us-about-german-humanism)
Amy Nelson Burnett

Thursday, January 9 | 12:00 - 1:15 PM | Wallenberg Hall, 433A

Letters were a vital means of communication for Germany’s learned elite in the early sixteenth century. Although scholars have long studied the published correspondence of individual German humanists, they have paid little attention to the metadata that provides a larger overview of the network created by those letters. My presentation will describe the shape of that correspondence network on the eve of the Reformation, using social network analysis to trace the flow of news, information, and ideas and to identify significant attributes of network members that helped shape group identity.

This seminar is cosponsored by Religious Studies, History, and CMEMS.

The presentation will include lunch and take place at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis in Wallenberg 433A. A Zoom link is available upon request.

About the Presenter
Amy Nelson Burnett is Paula and D.B. Varner University Professor of History at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Her research examines the dissemination of the Reformation in south Germany and Switzerland through print, preaching, and educational reform, and she is now using a database of early modern correspondence to analyze the connections between German humanism and the early Reformation. She is the author of Debating the Sacraments: Print and Authority in the Early Reformation (2019) and Karlstadt and the Origins of the Eucharistic Controversy: A Study in the Circulation of Ideas (2011), and co-editor of A Companion to the Swiss Reformation (2016). She has received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, the American Philosophical Society, the Fulbright Scholar Program, and the University of Wisconsin’s Institute for Research in the Humanities.

Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series: Transformations in the Archives (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/mellon-sawyer-seminar-series-transformation-archives-alisea-mcleod-and-bethany-nowviskie)
Alisea McLeod & Bethany Nowviskie

Thursday, January 11 | 5:30 - 7:00 PM | Wallenberg Hall, 433A

Paper archives have long been foundational sources of data for humanities scholars–be these materials organized as logs and records or correspondences and various other writings, institutionally produced and preserved or recovered by other means. This seminar will explore how archives have functioned thus far and how they can be newly envisioned in the digital era. What are the risks and rewards of digital archives? What are our corresponding responsibilities–as archivists and scholars of archives in the digital era? What makes a digital data archive? What are their ethics in the new digital formats of accessibility and of preservation? Can we revolutionize the burdens that accompany past archives?

This is the third event in the Mellon Sawyer Seminar series, The Data that Divides Us: Recalibrating Data Methods for New Knowledge Frameworks Across the Humanities, generously funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. During Stanford University's 2023-24 academic year, the Sawyer Seminar Series will convene scholars from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and personal standpoints to discuss the data that has saturated our world.

This event will be preceded by a reception at 5:00 p.m. at the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) on the fourth floor of Wallenberg Hall (Bldg. 160), Stanford University.

With University of Georgia professor Scott Nesbit and University of Sydney
Lecturer in Political Economy John Clegg, McLeod successfully wrote for an NEH Advancement Grant—Freedom’s Movement: African American Space in War and Reconstruction--in 2018. She has been part of other grant projects including a 2019-2020 Humanities Grant for the Public Good funded by the Council of Independent Colleges and Mellon.

Alisea Mcleod will be joined in her presentation by Cynthia McLeod who is s a PhD Student in the Department of Communication at UCSB.

She then went on to receive her MSc in Digital Anthropology at University College London in 2019, completing her master's thesis titled, Black Twitter: Temporality, (re)Spatializations, and Placemaking. Cynthia's research interests continue to lie at the intersection of all things digital, black culture, and community related, with a keen concentration on social media and the construction of worlds/reality.
