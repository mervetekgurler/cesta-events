Using Wikipedia to Understand the Digital Global Public Sphere and its Discontents: The Case of 'Cancel Culture' (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/using-wikipedia-understand-digital-global-public-sphere-and-its-discontents-case-cancel)

Tuesday, April 16 | 12:00-1:15 PM | Wallenberg Hall 433a

On Tuesday, April 16th, between 12 and 1:15 pm, Professor Adrian Daub will be presenting on his project "Using Wikipedia to Understand the Digital Global Public Sphere and Its Discontents: The Case of ‘Cancel Culture’". He will be talking about global trends and rhetorics of cancel culture, and analysis of the dissemination of this cultural phenomenon as well as networks of people and institutions involved in cancelling and being cancelled utilizing methods of text mining and data visualizations. This presentation is in anticipation of his upcominng book with Stanford University Press (September 2024), The Cancel Culture Panic: How an American Obsession Went Global. Lunch will be served during the event,and there is a Zoom option available as well. Please RSVP via this link (https://forms.gle/fadRfZdJzeh3RwxFA)  to receive the Zoom information.

Adrian Daub is the Barbara D. Finberg Director of the Clayman Institute, a position he began in 2019. He is the J. E. Wallace Sterling Professor of the Humanities and a professor of comparative literature and German studies in the School of Humanities and Sciences.

He writes about politics, literature, culture, and universities for German and Swiss newspapers and for Anglo-American outlets. Together with Laura Goode, he hosts the Clayman Institute’s podcast, The Feminist Present, which features interviews with a range of feminist voices. For the podcast In Bed With the Right, Moira Donegan and Daub welcome scholars and critics to analyze right wing ideas about gender, sex and sexuality – and to plumb the ways in which these ideas persist in and shape our present moment. His recent book, What the Ballad Knows: The Ballad Genre, Memory Culture, and German Nationalism, provides a thorough history of the ballad at the intersection of literary, musical, and visual arts, showing how the German ballad subverted and complicated the national project during the 19th century. A book in German, Cancel Culture Transfer: How a Moral Panic is Gripping the World, was published in November 2022. The Dynastic Imagination: Family and Modernity in Nineteenth-Century
Germany offers an unexpected account of modern German intellectual history through frameworks of family and kinship. In 2020, he published What Tech Calls Thinking, an examination of the intellectual underpinnings of Silicon Valley and the tech industry. Together with Charles Kronengold he wrote The James Bond Songs: Pop Anthems of Late Capitalism.

Daub’s research focuses on the intersection of literature, music and philosophy, particularly in the 19th century. His book Uncivil Unions - The Metaphysics of Marriage in German Idealism and Romanticism explores German philosophical theories of marriage from Kant to Nietzsche. His book Tristan's Shadow - Sexuality and the Total Work of Art deals with eroticism in German opera after Wagner. Four-Handed Monsters ties the practice of four-hand piano playing to ideologies about gender, labor, and the family in nineteenth-century Europe. In addition, he has published articles on opera, film, and poetry, as well as literature and scandal.

Fellowships with Gale Digital Scholar Lab (https://www.gale.com/intl/primary-sources/digital-humanities/fellowships/case-studies)

The ASEH announces three non-residential scholarships funded by the Gale Digital Scholar Lab.

The ASEH-Gale Non-Residential Fellowship will support research or teaching projects that rely on Gale Primary Sources and use digital humanities methodologies. Award fellows will be given free access to Gale Digital Scholar Lab (https://aseh.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode=EbDtFSPDHoEAiYTbK0vGFQo%2bHdiH6iVVLZpHLmad3lWFNiuV1CpwdxbU0XuAm2DDsiu%2bBUfN3PzN8xc7YRL0FWY0zIArYzUyt5e%2fyYqOe%2bk%3d)  to use with Environmental History (https://aseh.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode=v19B%2b6QbaSnksshPzIUtNmKxkzb2CpjSDL%2bvnUP4bcAfj5OKIphZwUbMcEaEv3tP29ZYIZnRAaomO9oitBoPfh81TAIRJsYtYki6R7flE20%3d)  for the duration of their fellowship. Applicants may also request access to other Gale Collections related to their research (https://www.gale.com/primary-sources (https://aseh.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode=p2znm6NaMFTFA%2fVH9o%2bVzIeXjWXq3obAHgT60sRQ2kSK7flmP6DSm7odYJy4jiC6YZxHKzsGh9uXQbHTf8gQQMut4VCBJVIE9Z6sUCpNWJU%3d) ). Applicants must
make clear how they will use digital methods such as text mining and the corpus of materials in Gale Primary Sources to further their research or teaching. The Digital Scholar Lab is designed for researchers new to digital humanities methods or with no coding experience, and the fellowships do not require prior experience with text mining.

There will be three ASEH-Gale Non-Residential Fellowships available. Each award will be $2,500 USD. Fellowships will be awarded by June 1, 2024 and must be completed by November 30, 2024.

Recipients of the Gale Fellowship will be invited to submit a panel proposal at the 2025 ASEH Annual Conference, where they will have the opportunity to share the results of their research projects. In addition, Fellows will receive an additional $500 stipend from Gale to present their work at the ASEH 2025 conference in Pittsburgh, to assist with their travel and accommodation expenses.

Find examples from previous Gale Digital Fellowship projects on this website: https://www.gale.com/intl/primary-sources/digital-humanities/fellowships/case-studies (https://aseh.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode=wjcW%2bvTt6ruY93eKKx%2fpv5xOZaelPEBq0G2YIyFMAdWUATF6FjhA2LTB73sHgBvb%2bbbCG9ay0buqRhrA8%2bUJstG2bajznREtpd4jT9OQxWI%3d)

The application deadline is: Wednesday, May 10th at 11:59 pm ET

Stanford Research Computing Fellowship (https://srcc.stanford.edu/)

Stanford Research Computing (SRC (https://srcc.stanford.edu/) ) invites graduate students in the Humanities and Social Sciences to apply for a Summer Quarter fellowship to develop original digital research in our high-performance computing environment.

While the aim will be a professional-quality research project, we recognize that many students in these disciplines do not have experience doing digital research. Therefore, the internship will provide hands-on support from SRC’s Research Data Facilitator and the rest of the support staff as needed.

The fellowship will be awarded based on a project proposal, but we welcome projects at all stages of ideation and planning, and applicants of all experience and degree levels. We are especially interested in funding projects from early career scholars, master’s students, and individuals from underrepresented backgrounds. While some general coding experience is desired, Stanford Research Computing is prepared to offer project support in a broad range of areas.

There are three fellowships available, with the awardees forming a learning cohort. Each fellowship comes with a $5,000 stipend, as well as office space in Polya Hall. The recipients will be expected to give a final presentation on their project at the end of the quarter.

Those interested should complete the form  (https://forms.gle/FsTEi6gFvZAmvvac9) here (https://forms.gle/FsTEi6gFvZAmvvac9)  by April 23. Please direct questions to bcritt@stanford.edu (mailto:bcritt@stanford.edu) . The winner will be announced May 1
