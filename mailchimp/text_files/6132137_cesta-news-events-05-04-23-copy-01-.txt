** Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online: Socially-Engaged Digital Humanities  (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/saving-ukrainian-cultural-heritage-online-socially-engaged-digital-humanities)
------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday, May 9 | 12:00 -1:15 | Wallenberg 433A

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has put cultural heritage right in the line of fire. Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online (SUCHO) is an online grassroots initiative of more than 1,500 volunteers which supports the digital preservation of Ukrainian culture. SUCHO started as an emergency web-archiving effort, preserving more than 50TB of cultural data from over 5,000 websites of Ukrainian museums, libraries and archives. In recent months SUCHO, has expanded its efforts to donating digitization hardware to Ukrainian institutions and creating online platforms for the preservation and exhibition of digitized and born-digital heritage. In this keynote, the three SUCHO co-founders and long-term volunteers will discuss what it takes to turn remote volunteers into digital activists. Furthermore, the speakers will outline the crucial role Open Access plays for the digital preservation of culture in emergency scenarios such as wars and natural disasters.

This event is cosponsored with the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.

The presentation will include lunch and take place at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis in Wallenberg 433A. A Zoom link is available upon request from Center Manager, Jonathan Clark (jclark93@stanford.edu (mailto:jclark93@stanford.edu) ).
