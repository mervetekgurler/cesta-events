** CISTERN: Database of Geographical Knowledge in the Ottoman World

About this talk: CISTERN is building a database and a virtual research space that bring together a wide range of geographical books, atlases, land descriptions, and maps in Turkish, Arabic, and English produced between the 15th and early 20th-centuries. Initially rare artifacts, these objects gradually became part of everyday life, reflecting the rise of territorialized states, intensifying militarization, and sweep capitalization of Middle Eastern economies. That Islamic geographers were instrumental in the transmission of classical spatial knowledge, such as Ptolemy’s Optics, to the European Renaissance is well known. Subsequent knowledge production, however, remains overlooked.

As a team, CISTERN has been working on a database and a virtual space that enable researchers to dive into the depths of this material, map its stratified flows of data, and explore the undercurrents of politics, economy, and culture from the perspective of objects such as atlases, compendiums, and maps. The searchable database incorporates existing bibliographical repositories, reframing them to respond to the needs of current users across fields and disciplines. This tool is housed in a virtual space that has the basic architecture of a cistern, a calm underground space sustaining a bustling city. It includes an exhibit hall and a reading room where the database can be searched and visualized. The pairing of the database with a virtual space is designed to generate new research questions in the history of the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe while offering an immersive environment to conduct research, engage with heritage, and focus one’s attention.

Adrien Zakar, Merve Tekgürler, and Umar Patel will introduce the project for 40 minutes and then open the floor for questions and input. Adrien is a Mellon postdoctoral scholar at the Stanford Humanities Center and will join the University of Toronto as Assistant Professor of Near and Middle East Studies and the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology in the fall of 2021. Merve is a Ph.D. student at the Stanford Department of History and a graduate mentor at CESTA. Umar is an undergraduate student at Stanford majoring in Computer Science and Archaeology and a CESTA intern working on the project.

About this talk: This research seminar aims to explicitly consider that research happens in context. This presentation proposes to address the topic of born-digital heritage and in particular of web archives in context. It aims to question the past, present, and future paths of research based on the plethora of born-digital sources that developed from the mid-1990s. Analysis of web archives requires both taking into account the very shaping of these archives - e.g. web archiving in context - and placing research on these web archives in context, from the early studies of the 2000s, which focused on the nature of web archives themselves and the methods for studying them, to current research that takes them as sources for exploring digital cultures. Thus, the first two parts of our presentation, devoted respectively to the history of web archiving and of web archives in research, will explore the multiple contextual elements at work. These may be related to the Web itself and its evolution,
to institutional policies, or to crawling and analysis tools. Understanding them is crucial for addressing the current and future challenges that will arise for researchers, whether they concern transnational approaches, ethical issues, or a claim for enhanced contextualization. In conclusion, we will broaden the question to digital humanities and consider why web archive studies have remained relatively marginalized in digital humanities discourse.

Valérie Schafer specializes in the history of computing, telecommunications and data networks. Her main research interests are the history of the Internet and the Web, the history of European digital cultures and infrastructures, and born-digital heritage (especially Web archives). Jane Winters's research interests include digital history, born-digital archives (particularly the archived web), the use of social media by cultural heritage institutions, and open access publishing. She has published most recently on Non-Print Legal Deposit and web archives, born-digital archives and the problem of search, and the archiving and analysis of national web domains.
