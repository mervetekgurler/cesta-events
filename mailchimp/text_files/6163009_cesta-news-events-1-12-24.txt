Dear all,

We are excited to start off this quarter with various CESTA events as well as both new and continuing programming. We are thrilled to welcome new cohorts of both DH Research Fellows and Undergraduate Research Interns involved at CESTA in Winter and Spring quarters. OurMellon Sawyer Seminar Series (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/stanford-receives-major-mellon-foundation-award-be-hosted-center-spatial-and-textual-analysis) , "The Data that Divides Us", will continue for Winter and Spring quarters and we are kicking off the new Sawyer Graduate Reading Group (#sawyer) - find more information about it below! CESTA will also be hosting a new community-oriented program series "Coffee, Cookies, Computers" starting this Winter - stay tuned!
We are also happy to be welcoming a new staff member, Stanford graduate Eyüp Eren Yürek, who will join us later this month as a Programs and Research Coordinator. Please stop by Wallenberg Hall and welcome Eren to CESTA!

The 2023 CESTA Research Anthology (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/announcing-cestas-2023-research-anthology)

CESTA is proud to announce the publication of our 2023 Research Anthology, which details a fruitful year of DH work carried out at CESTA, from the perspective of the undergraduate researchers whose work supports these projects.I (https://drive.google.com/file/d/10QbSZYGn-umgbS50KaWZxZ4PBI3EHyOn/view?usp=sharing) n the Anthology's pages (https://drive.google.com/file/d/10QbSZYGn-umgbS50KaWZxZ4PBI3EHyOn/view?usp=sharing) , you can read about the experiences of these researchers and the wide array of research projects that were carried out at CESTA in the last year. We will host a launch party for everyone involved with the anthology at CESTA early this quarter. Please be on the lookout for that email and mark your calendars for the event to come!

News & Announcements

Introducing the Sawyer Graduate Reading Group

Happy New Year, digital-enthusiast humanists of Stanford!
The Sawyer Graduate Reading Group is convening in the Winter and Fall to discuss applications of “The Data that Divide Us.” Our programming compliments the Mellon Sawyer Seminar (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/stanford-receives-major-mellon-foundation-award-be-hosted-center-spatial-and-textual-analysis?search=mellon+sawyer)  offerings, with a focus on bringing graduate students in the humanities into the conversation.

In Winter, we will discuss the work of two Stanford researchers: Quinn Dombrowski and Anne Ladyem McDivitt. Quinn’s work focuses on multilingual computational text analysis. Anne Ladyem is a historian with a focus on digital and public history. After reading and discussing their work, the data they use, the challenges it presents, and the methods they use to overcome those challenges, we will meet with Quinn and Anne Ladyem to ask questions and hear firsthand their perspectives and experiences on the management of textual and geospatial data, and the broader use of data in humanistic research.

In the Spring, we will turn to the research of the Sawyer Seminar's invited speakers (Dagomar Degroot, Jessica Otis, Greg O'Malley, Alex Borucki, Lauren Klein), again focusing on the theoretical issues engendered by these scholars' data sources and the practical methods that these researchers avail themselves of in their approach to data.

All Stanford Humanities graduates are welcome! Mark your calendars for January 16, January 23, February 13, February 20, April 2, April 16, and May 7. These are all Tuesdays, and meetings will take place between 12:00-1:15. Wallenberg 434. Lunch will be provided.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Your Mellon Sawyer Dissertation Fellows,

Chloé Brault (PhD Candidate in Comparative Literature) and
Matt Warner (PhD Candidate in English)

New Publication:
What We Teach When We Teach DH: Digital Humanities in the Classroom  (https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/what-we-teach-when-we-teach-dh)

A new volume, published by the University of Minnesota Press, explores how digital humanities teaching can transform educational opportunities in high school and university settings  - including the work of CESTA affiliates and community members! CESTA's own Alix Keener, along with co-author Chelcie Juliet Rowell, contributes the chapter 'Sharing Authority in Collaborative Digital Humanities Pedagogy: Library Workers’ Perspectives," and affiliate Quinn Dombroski writes on " Bringing Languages into the DH Classroom."

CESTA Affiliates Receive NEH Grant (https://www.neh.gov/news/neh-announces-338-million-260-humanities-projects-nationwide)

Mark Algee-Hewitt (https://cesta.stanford.edu/people/mark-algee-hewitt) and Eric Harvey (https://www.google.com/search?q=eric+harey+stanford&rlz=1C1RXQR_enUS1002US1002&oq=eric+harey+stanford&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIICAEQABgNGB7SAQg0ODI0ajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)  have received a Digital Humanities Advancement Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The grant will support their project, "Digital Accessibility for Blind Scholars of Antiquity." The project will involve the integration of six ancient languages into an open-source Braille digital translation platform to enable the creation of digital editions and primary sources for blind and low-vision humanities students and researchers. Congratulations, Mark and Eric!
