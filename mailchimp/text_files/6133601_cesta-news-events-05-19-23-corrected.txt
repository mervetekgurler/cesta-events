Featuring presentations by:
The Digital Humanities Graduate Fellows &
Undergraduate Research Interns
Friday, May 26 | 8:30 AM - 5:00 PM | Wallenberg 433A

Every year, CESTA's Digital Humanities Fellows Program supports graduate students developing humanities research projects that apply computational tools and methods. Attend this day-long showcase to hear directly from this year's cohort about the projects they pursued through the program. Many will present together with the undergraduate students with whom they collaborated. In the afternoon, in a dedicated poster session, a selection of students from this year's CESTA Undergraduate Research Internship Program (https://cesta.stanford.edu/people/2023-undergraduate-research-interns)  will present their contributions to CESTA faculty research projects.

The showcase will include lunch and refreshments and take place at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis in Wallenberg 433A. Join us for this day of celebration of CESTA research. A Zoom link is available upon request from Center Manager, Jonathan Clark (jclark93@stanford.edu (mailto:jclark93@stanford.edu) ).

Stanford Research Computing Graduate Fellowship in the Humanities and Social Sciences

Stanford Research Computing (https://srcc.stanford.edu/)  invites graduate students in the Humanities and Social Sciences to apply for a Summer Quarter fellowship to develop original digital research in a high-performance computing environment. While the aim will be to develop a professional-quality research project, we recognize that many students in these disciplines do not have extensive experience doing digital research. Therefore, the internship will provide hands-on instruction from the SRC’s Research Data Facilitator and the rest of the SRC staff as needed. While some general coding experience is desired, it is not strictly required, and we are prepared to offer project support in a broad range of areas.

The fellowship will be awarded based on a project proposal, but we welcome projects at all stages of ideation and planning, and applicants of all experience and degree levels. We are especially interested in funding projects from early career scholars, master’s students, and individuals from underrepresented backgrounds, though all applicants will be given serious consideration. The fellowship provides a $5,000 stipend along with office space in Polya Hall. The fellowship opportunity will culminate in a presentation of the research project at the end of summer. Those interested should complete the form here (https://forms.gle/6f6nE2GoyJjNTKRdA)  by May 24, 2023. Please direct questions to bcritt@stanford.edu (mailto:bcritt@stanford.edu) . The fellow will be announced June 1.
