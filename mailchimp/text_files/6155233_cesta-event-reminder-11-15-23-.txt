Introduction to CATMA - Software for Digital Text Annotation and Analysis
Thursday, November 16 | 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM | Wallenberg Hall 433A

This workshop introduces the practice of digital text annotation with CATMA 7 (https://catma.de/)  (Computer Assisted Text Markup and Analysis). CATMA is an annotation tool specifically designed for humanities research practice. The software can be used to manage multiple projects that combine documents, annotation categories, and team members. At the core of the software is the annotation area, where texts can be annotated either with predefined categories or according to heuristics developed during the research process. All annotations and comments can then be analyzed, visualized and quantitatively evaluated.

This workshop is cosponsored with the Department of English.

The workshop will include coffee and pastries and take place at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis in Wallenberg 433A. A Zoom link is available upon request from Office Management Intern, Daniela Perez (perezd20@stanford.edu (mailto:perezd20@stanford.edu) ).
