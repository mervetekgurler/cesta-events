Hybrid workshop: register here (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6H7ygDGMkCarQjFEEEk6nGw7MmyOsf9gCxkWu0Axkk_8PPg/viewform)  (in-person and remote)

Presenters: Elaine Treharne (Professor of English), Rachel Midura (Assistant Professor of Digital History, Virginia Tech), Mae Velloso-Lyons (PhD Candidate, Comparative Literature), Allyn Waller (PhD Candidate, Classics)

As digital humanists, we work in modern languages, but we do not necessarily work on them. The technologies and resources we work with are often designed not just for particular modern languages (e.g. the focus of natural language research on English), but for particular language paradigms that are not historically immutable. For scholars working on early printed material, aligning modern tools with premodern conventions such as irregular spelling, now archaic language or rubrication is simply another part of doing work in the digital humanities, while for scholars working with manuscript sources, the problems—abbreviations, mixed use of scripts, variant letterforms and more—are even more numerous and inescapable. How do we approach these problems? What technical solutions are available, and what do we lose in implementing them? What can our work on pre-modern language teach us about how to work with modern language?
DH Long View Seminar Series Launches March 10!

This seminar series (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/dh-longview-seminar-series-launches-march-10) is co-hosted by scholars living in three countries, nine time zones apart. Building upon the successful “Digital Humanities Longview” series (2021), this is a further bridging of trans-Atlantic digital humanities centres to promote a global conversation. We are committed to fostering rich international discussions from a diverse range of perspectives, with an emphasis on reflective practice.

Co-hosted by UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, the Centre for Digital Humanities, Uppsala, & the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis, Stanford.
