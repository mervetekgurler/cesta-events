Tyler Kynn
On the Road to Mecca: Simulating the Ottoman Hajj
Hybrid event. In-person at CESTA and via Zoom.

Abstract: My current digital project, The Hajj Trail (www.hajjtrail.com (http://www.hajjtrail.com/) ), aims to build an interactive teaching tool that allows students to engage with the social history of the seventeenth-century Ottoman Empire. The Hajj Trail takes students along the route of the seventeenth-century Ottoman pilgrimage road to Mecca, introducing them to the cultural history of the early modern Ottoman World. The goal of the project is to present the history of the Ottoman Empire/Islamic World to a broader public in a narrative which does not center perceptions of the region around violence and warfare – as is depicted in most other digital media. The entire project is built through a user-friendly coding platform called Twine and presents students with historical scenarios based upon early modern travel and pilgrimage narratives. The talk will outline both the goals of this project and overview the tools that we utilized to build it.

About the speaker: Dr. Tyler Kynn is an instructor of Global History at the University of Memphis, and his primary research focus is the seventeenth-century Ottoman pilgrimage to Mecca. Dr. Kynn received his Ph.D. in History from Yale University in 2020 and combines his research on the Ottoman hajj with his digital humanities project, The Hajj Trail. This project aims to be the public facing digital medium for his study of the intersection of the early modern hajj, empire, and the seasonality of imperial power.

Every year, CESTA's Digital Humanities Graduate Fellowship (https://cesta.stanford.edu/graduate-programs/digital-humanities-graduate-fellowship)  supports graduate students and post-docs to produce original research using the tools and methods of the digital humanities. Join us to see the 2021-22 cohort of scholars (https://cesta.stanford.edu/dh-graduate-fellows-2021-22)  present their research!

More information and event details may be found here (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/showcase-2022) .

This event is open to Stanford affiliates only. We hope you will join us in person at CESTA, but if you require a Zoom link, please write to: m.velloso-lyons@stanford.edu.

Critical Data Practices
Critical Data Practices Symposium
Date and time: opening and reception 4pm on Thursday June 2nd,  symposium Friday June 3rd (schedule TBA)
In-person event: registration details to follow

For some humanistic disciplines, data is nothing new; for others, conceiving of the material of study as “data” might entail significant shifts of thought. For all kinds of humanistic data, however, digital tools offer powerful new modes of inquiry, enabling us to work at new scales and on new kinds of material. But digital methods offer new challenges, too, asking us to confront what data might become in the contexts of the humanities and to consider the ethics of its collection, storage, and use. And, we must constantly face the challenge of integrating these methods into the practices of the humanities so that we do not abandon hard-won “analogue” expertise in the hasty pursuit of the latest computational methods.

Critical Data Practices has been considering these issues in our regular workshops this year. In this symposium we will be drawing into our conversation scholars and experts—faculty, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars—from our neighboring institutions up and down the Californian coast. Together, we will synthesize and elaborate what our workshops have already discussed on topics such as missing data, outliers versus averages, the futurity and archiving of data and methods, the affordances and difficulties of pre-modern data, strategies for communicating technical results, and the spatial element inherent to data.

Discussants will include: David Bamman (Berkeley), Sean Fraga (USC), Rachael King (UC Santa Barbara), Marit MacArthur (UC Davis)
