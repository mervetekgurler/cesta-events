This talk explores the pathways taken in the analysis of the social space of Rio de Janeiro in literature.  It also explores the imprint of social space on literature and, if possible, the reciprocal imprint of the literary space on the social.  As such, the aim is to examine the way DH methods and sensibilities may enter into long standing arguments about the relationship between urban social spaces (socially produced assemblages of material and mental constructs) and social identities typically represented in literature (in this case novels of growth and social integration). The talk will focus on mapping social and spatial patterns found in three canonical Brazilian novels.
Chair: Laura Stokes, Associate Professor of History, Stanford University
UCL Respondent: Madeline Tondi
Stanford Respondent: William Parish
