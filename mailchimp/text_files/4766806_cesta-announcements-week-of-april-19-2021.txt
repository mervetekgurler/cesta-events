About this event: Please join us for a virtual CIDR-CESTA lightning talk gathering. This is an informal event geared towards bringing together researchers working on DH projects to allow them to share ideas and challenges and to gather feedback and insights from peers. Short presentations on works-in-progress will be followed by open discussion.

This session will feature a talk by Vivian Yan-Gonzalez (PhD Student, History) on "Creating and Visualizing Historical Asian-American Voter Data." There's still space for one or two more speakers; sign up here (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWeSi0xC1unrgy_SaW4VwVs_gs4ZrVfr8bsdpDp_BZoQQopg/viewform) if interested.
