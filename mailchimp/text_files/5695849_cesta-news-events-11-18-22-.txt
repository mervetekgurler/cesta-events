"Structure as Meaning? Conflict as a Text Feature in German Literature" (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/evelyn-gius-structure-meaning-conflict-text-feature-german-literature)

Evelyn Gius
Professor of Digital Philology and Modern German Literature, Technical University Darmstadt

Tuesday, November 29 | 12-1.15 PM | Wallenberg 433A
About this event:  In this talk, Dr. Evelyn Gius will discuss the possibilities of building the analysis of conflict on the analysis of text features. This is a basis for the development of a computational literary studies approach to literary texts. In order to demonstrate its possible applications, Dr. Gius will outline how an operationalization of conflict can be applied at different levels of text analysis, ranging from single texts over groups of text to an overarching understanding of literary history as a (digital) history of conflict.

This event will include lunch.

About the Speaker: Evelyn Gius is Professor of Digital Philology and Modern German Literature at Technical University Darmstadt and head of the fortext lab (https://www.linglit.tu-darmstadt.de/institutlinglit/fachgebiete/digiphil/index.en.jsp) . Her research focuses on narrative theory, manual annotation, operationalization, segmentation, and conflict. She also leads the development of the annotation platform CATMA (https://catma.de/) and serves as chair of the Digital Humanities Association in the German-speaking areas ("Digital Humanities im deutschsprachigen Raum", DHd) and as co-editor of the Journal of Computational Literary Studies (JCLS) as well as of the book series "Digital Literary Studies."
