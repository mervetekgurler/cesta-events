** Building EdTech from the Inside Out: Challenges and Opportunities of EpicConnect (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/fyza-parviz-jazra-nelson-shuchmacher-endebo-and-ellis-schriefer-building-edtech-inside-out)
------------------------------------------------------------
Fyza Parviz Jaxra, Nelson Shuchmacher Endebo and Ellis Schriefer

Stanford University
Tuesday, February 14 | 12-1.15 PM | Wallenberg 433A

EpicConnect is an education technology product specifically designed to benefit community college instructors, and it is being built at CESTA. It is an open-source productivity platform that leverages Behavior Design principles to build community, enhance belonging, and help instructors collaborate on pedagogical projects. But something like EpicConnect cannot happen overnight, and in this presentation the co-founders of the project will share what they have learned, from product discovery and designing prototypes to user testing and the challenges and opportunities of creating user-centered tech for education.

This seminar is co-sponsored by Stanford Global Studies (https://sgs.stanford.edu/) .

The presentation will include lunch and take place at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis in Wallenberg 433A. A Zoom link is available upon request from Center Manager, Jonathan Clark (jclark93@stanford.edu (mailto:jclark93@stanford.edu) ).

News & Announcements

Tuesday, February 15 | 5:00 - 7:00 PM | Wallenberg 433A
The Critical Data Practices workshop explores the unique challenges that face the arts and humanities as we ground data-driven insights in real-world human complexity, and in various social, cultural, and historical contexts. The workshop gives particular attention to what the humanities have to say to data practices in the current moment and urges us to critically examine the issues of representation, equity, accessibility, and discoverability.

This panel will focus on the question “How can we adapt data practices to advance social and racial justice?” Following the short presentations by panelists, we will engage in a discussion about this topic.. Dinner will be provided prior to the workshop. Our panelists include Felicia Smith (https://profiles.stanford.edu/felicia-smith)  (Racial Justice and Social Equity Librarian at Stanford Libraries), Kemi Oyewole (https://cepa.stanford.edu/people/kemi-oyewole)  (doctoral student and IES Fellow at the GSE), and Raymond Zhang (https://ed.stanford.edu/about/community/raymond-zhang)  (MS student in Education Data Science at the GSE).
