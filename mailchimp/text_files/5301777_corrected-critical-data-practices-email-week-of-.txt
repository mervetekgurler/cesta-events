The Problem of Missing Data
In collaboration with the School for Advanced Study, University of London
Online event. Registration and Zoom link (https://forms.gle/ZPicmJttqcD7pYYP8) .

Can the quantity of data ever make up for its quality? What can we do about data that is necessarily incomplete, or where the incompleteness of the data is precisely what gives it its scholarly interest? How do we engage with vast quantities of data without losing sight of what’s been excluded—systemically, deliberately, or by happenstance—from the archive?

Chair: Jane Winters (Professor, Digital Humanities, SAS) Discussants: Caio Mello (Doctoral Researcher, Digital Humanities, SAS), Amara Thornton (Co-Investigator and Research Fellow, Classics, UCL), Anna-Maria Sichani (Post-Doctoral Research Associate, Digital Humanities, SAS), Naomi Wells (Lecturer, Modern Languages and Digital Humanities, SAS).
