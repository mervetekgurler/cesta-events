Alan Liu & Roopika Risam
Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series: The Place of Data (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/mellon-sawyer-seminar-series-place-data-alan-liu-and-roopika-risam)

Thursday, November 2 | 5:30-7:00 PM | Terrace Room, Margaret Jacks Hall (460)
Reception at 5:00 PM

Setting the stage for our future Mellon Sawyer Seminar discussions, The Place of Data will explore the various axes along which data has engendered the divisions that shape our current world. Whether those divisions lie along fault lines in geography, race, gender, or discipline, our initial seminar will situate our thinking about data within this complex web of cultural intersections. What dangers attend the use of data across these divisions and how might we use data itself to redress these concerns?

This is the first event in the Mellon Sawyer Seminar series, The Data that Divides Us: Recalibrating Data Methods for New Knowledge Frameworks Across the Humanities, generously funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. During Stanford University's 2023-24 academic year, the Sawyer Seminar Series will convene scholars from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and personal standpoints to discuss the data that has saturated our world.

The seminar will feature remarks from Prof. Alan Liu (Univerity of California, Santa Barbara) and Prof. Roopika Risam (Dartmouth) and a response from Prof. Mark Algee-Hewitt (Stanford). The event will be preceded by a reception at 5:00 p.m. in the Terrace Room of Margaret Jacks Hall (Bldg. 460). A Zoom link is available upon request from Office Management Intern, Daniela Perez (perezd20@stanford.edu (mailto:perezd20@stanford.edu) ).
