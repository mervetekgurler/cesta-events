** Runaway Enslaved Families in Senegal: Mothers, Children, Resistance, and Vulnerabilities, 1857-1903 (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/runaway-enslaved-families-senegal-mothers-children-resistance-and-vulnerabilities-1857-1903)
------------------------------------------------------------

Tuesday, May 14th | 5:00 - 6:30 PM | Wallenberg Hall 433a

CESTA and the Freedom and Slavery Workshop are co-hosting a dinner seminar on the "Senegalese Slave Liberations Project". Please join Richard Roberts (Professor Emeritus, Stanford History Department), and his students, Wallace Stevens (Stanford PhD Candidate) and Becca De Los Santos (Stanford Undergraduate Student) for this seminar session on their acclaimed digital humanities project, working on archiving and building an accessible database of the documents related to the liberated Senegalese people between 1857 and 1903. You can learn more about the project here (https://cesta.stanford.edu/research/senegal-liberations-project) .

Dinner will be served. Please RSVP to the talk here (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjJ6nd5zZ1ISJTV6F4rMeU9al_fF54fQCrhqaHabpO1L6wYA/viewform) . Zoom attendance is available as well. Use the RSVP form to request a Zoom link.

The Senegal Liberations Project will present their new paper focusing on runaway enslaved families: Despite significant risks; enslaved people have always had recourse to desertion. Running away was an act of resistance. It often meant leaving behind subsistence, security, and a sense of belonging. It also opened up enslaved persons to the consequences of potential recapture, violence, and material deprivation.  Women’s gendered vulnerabilities exacerbated these risks, especially when they had children. In Senegambia, enslaved women never held legal custody of their own children, who belonged to the mother’s owner, no matter the father’s identity. Enslaved women, thus, frequently ran away not only to gain their freedom, but to maintain guardianship of their children. Between 1857 and 1903, nearly 29,000 enslaved men, women, and children requested formal “certificates of liberation” from French colonial authorities. In our preliminary analysis, we have identified just over 1,400 runaway
families in the registers. Mothers, not fathers, appear most regularly as children’s guardians. This pattern points to significant, strategic, and gendered acts of resistance.  Our paper probes the gendered demographics of runaway families, examining changes over time and families’ compositions to recover patterns of everyday resistance to slavery and portray the dynamics of enslaved family formation in Senegambia.

Mellon Sawyer Seminar


** Ayesha K. Hardison:
Recuperating Forgotten Narratives   (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/mellon-sawyer-seminar-series-recuperating-forgotten-narratives-part-2-ayesha-hardison)
------------------------------------------------------------

Thursday, May 16th | 5:30-7:00 PM | Wallenberg Hall 433a

Previous seminars in our series have attended to divisions, but also possibilities, engendered by data along various fault lines and contexts (from 19th-century statistical thinking to biases in archives, from the challenges of quantification to the history of data governance). With this seminar on ‘Recuperating Forgotten Narratives’ we focus on what happens to text when it is digitized and turned into data. What new possibilities open up with this type of textual data? What new narratives can be written about past and present textual traditions? What remains irretrievable?

This is the eighth event in the Mellon Sawyer Seminar series, The Data that Divides Us: Recalibrating Data Methods for New Knowledge Frameworks Across the Humanities, generously funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. During Stanford University's 2023-24 academic year, the Sawyer Seminar Series has convened scholars from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and personal standpoints to discuss the data that has saturated our world.

Professor Ayesha Hardison will talk about the work of digitizing and making accessible the history of Black writing, as texts and recordings are collected, curated and transformed from an archival project to data and digital texts, sounds and visuals. Following the talk, there will be a response by Chloé Brault (PhD candidate in Comparative Literature at Stanford).

We will have a reception before the talk, starting at 5 pm. If you cannot join us in person, you can request a Zoom link through this link (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJctdu6urTIvH9VJMG0-mawZmG7s4mzTZRXm#/registration) .

Ayesha K. Hardison is Associate Professor of English and Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at the University of Kansas. Her research and teaching explore questions of race, gender, genre, social politics, and historical memory. She is the author of Writing through Jane Crow: Race and Gender Politics in African American Literature (University of Virginia Press, 2014), is co-editor with Eve Dunbar of African American Literature in Transition: 1930–1940 (Cambridge University Press, 2022), and has published several book chapters as well as articles in African American Review and Meridians. Hardison has received fellowships and awards from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Schomburg Center Scholars-In-Residence Program, Black Metropolis Research Consortium, National Humanities Center Summer Residency Program, Humanities Kansas, and the Ford Foundation. She is director of the History of Black Writing (HBW) and co-editor of the multidisciplinary journal Women, Gender, and Families of
Color.  She also works on the Mellon funded project Stories for All: A Digital Storytelling Project for the Twenty-First Century (https://storiesforall.org/story/history-of-black-writing/) and co-directs Project on the History of Black Writing (https://hurston.ku.edu (https://hurston.ku.edu/) ).

** Reflections on the Digital Humanities: A Conversation with Mark Algee-Hewitt (https://shc.stanford.edu/arcade/interventions/reflections-digital-humanities-conversation-mark-algee-hewitt)
------------------------------------------------------------

SHC's Arcade have published the first in a series of interviews concerning DH work at Stanford, The Digital Humanities has existed as an institutionalized field of research at Stanford for now more than a decade, drawing undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers from around the globe. This series, a collaboration between Arcade and Stanford’s Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis, spotlights leading research in the digital humanities at Stanford, and asks key contributors to reflect on the expansion of the field, its culture, and the major misconceptions that remain.

Why has this field sparked so much public engagement in its projects and debates? How has the digital humanities changed what it means to be a more “traditional” humanist? And how is the field engaging new developments in technology like artificial intelligence?

In this interview (https://shc.stanford.edu/arcade/interventions/reflections-digital-humanities-conversation-mark-algee-hewitt) , Interventions editor, Charlotte Lindemann, speaks with Associate Professor of English and Director of the Stanford Literary Lab, Mark Algee-Hewitt.
