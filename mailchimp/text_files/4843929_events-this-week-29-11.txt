Critical Data Practices Workshop

Making Data for the Future
Hybrid format. Register here (https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqMONWzo2uCb_VX_hqmFDGSXHY5Im6oGoXuGSTo1dq4SJVmA/viewform?usp=send_form) .

Presenters: Laura Stokes (Associate Professor of History), Alix Keener (CESTA and Stanford Libraries), Yunxin Li (PhD Candidate, History), and Matt Warner (PhD Candidate, English).
About this event: As scholars, we are accustomed to thinking about the accountability of our scholarship to the future, but what about the future of our data? Will future scholars want access to the data we collect in the here and now, and if so, how and in what ways? Should we store only the data needed to reproduce our work, or do we go out of our way to provide data we collected and perhaps analyzed, but did not ultimately use? Professional guidelines tell us what to do with sensitive data, but what about material that feels like it shouldn’t be shared for other reasons, or simply doesn’t seem like it will be useful? And how does the provision of data intersect with the preservation of analytic tools and code? Finally, who and when are we storing our data for—ourselves, or others? Next year, or the next century?
The Critical Data Practices Workshop Series explores the unique challenges that face the arts and humanities as we ground data-driven insights in real-world human complexity, and in various social, cultural, and historical contexts. Digitization and computational methods provide new opportunities for understanding the cultural implications of data, its meaning, and its significance to the long history of recorded human experience. We must therefore carefully consider the ways that we derive meaning from data through critical attention to methods and sources. The workshop gives particular attention to what the humanities have to say to data practices in the current moment and urges us to critically examine the issues of representation, equity, accessibility, and discoverability.

Elaine Treharne, Stanford

Premodern Books as Inhabited Objects
Hybrid format. Join via Zoom (https://stanford.zoom.us/j/97079079488?pwd=Zk9URThqL0krWXpPU2NtUHBKL0tVZz09) (password: 860160) or join us in 260-252 (The German Studies Library).

About this talk: This talk will outline the central book historical thesis of Professor Treharne's recently published Oxford University Press book, Perceptions of Medieval Manuscripts: The Phenomenal Book. She'll discuss how this has inspired new research on medieval women scribes, categories of description in medieval literary cultures, and elitism in the field of Medieval (and Early Modern) Studies at large.
About the speaker: Elaine Treharne, FSA, FRHistS, FEA, FSLW, is Roberta Bowman Denning Professor of Humanities and Professor of English. She works on the long history of technologies of text and is a former director of CESTA.

December 2, 12-1.15PM

Stephen Samson, Cornell

Digital Philology and the Measure of Greek Epic
In person. Classics Seminar Room (Bldg 110, Rm 112).
This event is part of "The Future of the Past", a Stanford Humanities Center Workshop hosted by Prof. Hans Bork, Rachel Dubit, and Annie Lamar.

About this talk: Homeric philology presents challenges—and opportunities—to recent developments in computational literary studies. Although the epic corpus is meager in comparison to the massive amount of modern literature, quantitative approaches to hexameter poetry from the early 20th century onward provide promising ways to leverage stylistic data for close reading Archaic, Hellenistic, and Imperial Greek epic. This talk demonstrates how metrical data, particularly the sedes of lemmata, uncovers intertexts, enhances interpretation, and enriches perspectives on style, formula, and narrative.
About the speaker: Stephen Sansom is a Hellenist specializing in early Greek poetry and its reception, especially epic, aesthetics, and digital humanities. He received his PhD in Classics from Stanford University in 2018 before joining Cornell's Department of Classics as a Postdoctoral Associate and fellow in the Active Learning Initiative. He is an alumnus of CESTA's Digital Humanities Graduate Fellowship.
