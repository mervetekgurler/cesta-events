Elaine A. Sullivan
Sacred Vision at Saqqara: Reimagining the sensorium of the dead at an ancient Egyptian necropolis in 3D (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/elaine-sullivan-sacred-vision-saqqara-reimagining-sensorium-dead-ancient-egyptian-necropolis)

Tuesday, April 30 | 12:00-1:15 PM | Wallenberg Hall 433a

This workshop introduces one of the most effective forms of ritual communication and connection in ancient Egyptian culture which took place through human sight. Seeing was a reciprocal act, with the eye an active agent that reached out—a concept likely stemming from the myth of the powerful ‘divine eye’. In looking upon the god (or the king in his divine form), a person interacted with him or her, benefited from their divine presence, and could even be healed by this vision, and thus prayers to ‘see the god’ were repeated in a variety of types of texts. The effect of such sacred vision (and other sensory experiences) was key for both the living and the dead. In this talk, I will argue that the necropolis landscape of Saqqara was structured to promote ritual sight lines and provide the deceased with eternal views of the god or king. For this study, I use primary source texts and artistic depictions related to funerary and mortuary cult events at the site of Saqqara, as well as data gleaned
from a 3D GIS model of the site that visualises physical and material elements of the cemetery frequently indiscernible today. Elaine A. Sullivan (M.A. and Ph.D. in Egyptian Art and Archaeology from Johns Hopkins University) is an Egyptologist and a Digital Humanist whose work focuses on applying new technologies to ancient cultural materials. Her born-digital publication, Constructing the Sacred, utilizes a geo-temporal 3D model of the necropolis of Saqqara (near modern Cairo) to investigate questions of ritual landscape and visibility at the site. This digital monograph (https://constructingthesacred.org (https://constructingthesacred.org/) , Stanford University Press, 2020) was awarded prizes by the American Historical Association and the Archaeological Institute of America. Her archaeological work in Egypt includes five seasons of excavation with Johns Hopkins University at the temple of the goddess Mut (Luxor), as well as four seasons in the field with a joint UCLA-Rijksuniversiteit
Groningen project in the Egyptian Fayum at the Greco-Roman town of Karanis.  Sullivan has published extensively on the use of digital technologies for research and scholarship.

This seminar is co-sponsored with the Stanford Global Studies as part of the SGS Global Approaches to Sacred Space.

This event will take place at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis in Wallenberg 433A. For Zoom information, visit  this page (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJIpceyrrD0oHdItGrYC7Ufo1FUfEPqRldap) .

James J. Hodge
Six Theses on an Aesthetics of Always-On Computing (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/six-theses-aesthetics-always-computing)

Tuesday, April 30 | 5:00-7:00 PM | Wallenberg Hall 433a

This talk comes from James Hodge's book project, "Ordinary Media: An Aesthetics of Always-On Computing." The premise of the project is that the smartphone has become for many the signature technology and engine of experience in the twenty-first century. One of the project's larger claims is that ambient givenness of smartphones in contemporary life has significantly reorganized the human sensorium and, moreover, has elevated the significance of experience at the level of the skin's surface, or what the psychoanalyst Thomas Ogden terms "boundedness."

This talk attends to the ways in which this dramatic shift in the general orientation of experience entails a sea change in the general nature of aesthetics native and responsive to the always-on world. Discussing a variety of examples from film, literature, video, games, digital art, and vernacular aesthetic forms and genres, this talk explores six "theses" of aesthetics in this still-novel yet ordinary arena.

This event is hosted by Digital Aesthetics Workshop and is co-sponsored with the Department of English and the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA).

James J. Hodge (he/him/his, Ph.D. University of Chicago) is an Associate Professor in the English Department of Northwestern University. He specializes in digital media aesthetics across several contexts, including new media art, popular and experimental cinema, animation, and literature. Focusing also on media and critical theory he has special interests in phenomenology and psychoanalysis. He is also a core faculty member of the interschool PhD program in Rhetoric, Media, and Publics, and affiliate faculty in Art History and Screen Cultures.

His research is broadly devoted to the question of how artistic forms express the incoherence of lived experience. His first book Sensations of History: Animation and New Media Art  (https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/sensations-of-history) (Minnesota, 2019) argues that animation becomes crucial for understanding the ways in which history changes in the digital age. His current book project, "Ordinary Media: An Aesthetics of Always-On Computing" examines a range of experimental and popular digital artworks in their capacity to express the felt dynamics of always-on computing: from depression and anxiety to sociability, productivity, and vulnerability. This and other recent work attend to the explosion of new networked genres such as supercuts, memes, selfies, and animated GIFs, and theorizes them as aesthetic strategies of provisional attunement to the vicissitudes of the historical present.

Fellowships with Gale Digital Scholar Lab (https://www.gale.com/intl/primary-sources/digital-humanities/fellowships/case-studies)

The ASEH announces three non-residential scholarships funded by the Gale Digital Scholar Lab.

The ASEH-Gale Non-Residential Fellowship will support research or teaching projects that rely on Gale Primary Sources and use digital humanities methodologies. Award fellows will be given free access to Gale Digital Scholar Lab (https://aseh.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode=EbDtFSPDHoEAiYTbK0vGFQo%2bHdiH6iVVLZpHLmad3lWFNiuV1CpwdxbU0XuAm2DDsiu%2bBUfN3PzN8xc7YRL0FWY0zIArYzUyt5e%2fyYqOe%2bk%3d)  to use with Environmental History (https://aseh.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode=v19B%2b6QbaSnksshPzIUtNmKxkzb2CpjSDL%2bvnUP4bcAfj5OKIphZwUbMcEaEv3tP29ZYIZnRAaomO9oitBoPfh81TAIRJsYtYki6R7flE20%3d)  for the duration of their fellowship. Applicants may also request access to other Gale Collections related to their research (https://www.gale.com/primary-sources (https://aseh.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode=p2znm6NaMFTFA%2fVH9o%2bVzIeXjWXq3obAHgT60sRQ2kSK7flmP6DSm7odYJy4jiC6YZxHKzsGh9uXQbHTf8gQQMut4VCBJVIE9Z6sUCpNWJU%3d) ). Applicants must
make clear how they will use digital methods such as text mining and the corpus of materials in Gale Primary Sources to further their research or teaching. The Digital Scholar Lab is designed for researchers new to digital humanities methods or with no coding experience, and the fellowships do not require prior experience with text mining.

There will be three ASEH-Gale Non-Residential Fellowships available. Each award will be $2,500 USD. Fellowships will be awarded by June 1, 2024 and must be completed by November 30, 2024.

Recipients of the Gale Fellowship will be invited to submit a panel proposal at the 2025 ASEH Annual Conference, where they will have the opportunity to share the results of their research projects. In addition, Fellows will receive an additional $500 stipend from Gale to present their work at the ASEH 2025 conference in Pittsburgh, to assist with their travel and accommodation expenses.
