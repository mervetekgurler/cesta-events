CESTA Summer Undergraduate Research Internship
Applications Due: Monday, March 20

CESTA invites applications for the full-time, in-person summer internship program (June 26-September 1). Summer research interns will have the opportunity to work with faculty on cutting-edge research projects and participate in an internship program through which they will connect with peers, develop new skills, and receive mentorship from two graduate students.

Interns may enroll for academic credit or a summer research stipend of $7500.

This summer CESTA will host more than 20 active projects, traversing the humanities and social sciences. To apply, students are asked to submit a one-page cover letter, resume, and a brief application coversheet. In the coversheet, applicants may indicate their preference of up to five active projects. For more information, visit the Undergraduate Research Internship Program webpage.  (https://cesta.stanford.edu/students/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-research-internship-program)

Applications are due Monday, March 20, and decisions will be announced by the end of April.
