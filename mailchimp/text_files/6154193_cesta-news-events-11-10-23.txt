Svenja Guhr
Sound in 19th Century Fiction (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/svenja-guhr-sound-19th-century-fiction)

Tuesday, November 14 | 12:00 - 1:15 PM | Wallenberg Hall 433A

Sounds are omnipresent in our everyday lives: cars whizzing around the corner or honking their horns, the wind rustling in the autumn leaves, people chatting, whispering, laughing. In literary texts, there is also a fictional soundscape, playfully animated by sound words such as adjectives, nouns or verbs used to describe sounds realized by characters or present in the ambience of the fiction. Since the beginning of the century, literary scholars have been increasingly immersed in the analysis of these descriptions, whether it be the analysis of the soundscape of Dicken's fictionalized London by Picker (2003) or of voices in the Gothic by Foley (2023).

This seminar is cosponsored with theDepartment of English. (https://english.stanford.edu/)

The presentation will include lunch and take place at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis in Wallenberg 433A. A Zoom link is available upon request from Office Management Intern, Daniela Perez (perezd20@stanford.edu (mailto:perezd20@stanford.edu) ).
Thursday at CESTA

Evelyn Guis & Svenja Guhr
Introduction to CATMA - Software for Digital Text Annotation and Analysis
Thursday, November 16 | 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM | Wallenberg Hall 433A

This workshop introduces the practice of digital text annotation with CATMA 7 (https://catma.de/)  (Computer Assisted Text Markup and Analysis). CATMA is an annotation tool specifically designed for humanities research practice. The software can be used to manage multiple projects that combine documents, annotation categories, and team members. At the core of the software is the annotation area, where texts can be annotated either with predefined categories or according to heuristics developed during the research process. All annotations and comments can then be analyzed, visualized and quantitatively evaluated.

This workshop is cosponsored with the Department of English.

The workshop will include coffee and pastries and take place at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis in Wallenberg 433A. A Zoom link is available upon request from Office Management Intern, Daniela Perez (perezd20@stanford.edu (mailto:perezd20@stanford.edu) ).

CESTA News & Announcements

The Undergraduate Research Internship (https://cesta.stanford.edu/students/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-research-internship-program) program empowers students to apply technologies across the Humanities and Social Sciences in ways that enhance our understanding of the world. Applications for the 2023-24 program are due November 22, 2023.

The Undergraduate Research Internship provides opportunities for undergraduates to work on CESTA research projects throughout the academic year. Through structured research training, experimentation with cutting-edge technologies, and faculty mentorship, students develop valuable academic and professional skill sets. Work on lab projects allows students to apply their developing expertise in data science, GIS, and web development in tandem with humanities skills in critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and ethical decision-making.

You can read about the experiences of recent interns in CESTA's 2022 Research Anthology (https://issuu.com/stanfordhumanities/docs/cesta_anthology_2022?fr=sN2Q0YzU2NDAzMTA) .
