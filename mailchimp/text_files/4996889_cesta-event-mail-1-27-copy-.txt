About this talk: This presentation explores George Moses Horton as an oral poet, from Oral Horton To Written Horton, and Now Digital Horton. Using the tools of digital technology, we are able to transport the reader (viewer) back to the Antebellum Chapel Hill, 1830s. In the early 1990s, game computer designers introduced a new concept into the game industry called the avatar. By using a computer game the player began “to experience” his playing of a game through the avatar. This concept of “experiencing” something—of having an “experience”—is entirely new in fiction narration. The narration had been limited to books, to reading.  Here was a new way to “experience” a narrative—without reading. Like Torben Groda, Professor of media art at the University of Copenhagen, we will present Horton's poetry as a game that is like a “real-life experience”. We ask, how might it be possible to use virtual reality to do just that—to “experience” Horton’s world as an ‘embodied’ experie
nce”?

In our demonstration, we create an Acoustic Avatar of George Moses Horton to show how the user can “experience” Horton’s poetry. In collaboration with Tylar Campbell, a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT) from Simon Fraser University, and Professor Steve DiPaola at the SIAT iVizLab, who is a highly regarded scholar and innovator with AI including GPT 3, computational systems for expression, movement, and gestures, we were able to create a virtual world for Horton and occupy this immersive experience. With Tylar as the role player in the game, we decided to allow the avatar/Horton to interact with other characters. In addition, we allowed Tylar to “improvise” with the essential story of the real Horton, along with real incidents. In other words, we learned to fictionalize the story through the avatar/character. We focused on analyzing the activities of a player through three angles: character creation, character interaction, and game mechanics.
DH Longview Seminar Series Launches March 10!

This seminar series is co-hosted by scholars living in three countries, nine time zones apart. Building upon the successful “Digital Humanities Longview” series (2021), this is a further bridging of trans-Atlantic digital humanities centres to promote a global conversation. We are committed to fostering rich international discussions from a diverse range of perspectives, with an emphasis on reflective practice.

Co-hosted by UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, the Centre for Digital Humanities, Uppsala, & the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis, Stanford.
