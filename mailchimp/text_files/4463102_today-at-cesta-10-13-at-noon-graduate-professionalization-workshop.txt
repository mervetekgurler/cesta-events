Today at 12 pm:
Graduate Professionalization Workshop for
Digital Humanists
Rachel Midura (Virginia Tech) &
Brian Johnsrud (Adobe)
In the context of Stanford's policy concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, CESTA events are online for now. We look forward to seeing you at CESTA when it is safe to gather again.

About this event: This workshop is aimed at helping graduate students find and take advantage of opportunities in the digital humanities and present their graduate work in CVs for both academic and non-academic professions.

Rachel Midura is Assistant Professor of Digital History at Virginia Tech. She completed a PhD at Stanford in 2020 in History that deployed data analytics to investigate early modern information networks. Having recently been a senior graduate research fellow at CESTA, Rachel is highly familiar with the Stanford environment. Rachel will discuss the space that digital humanities hold within the academy and offer strategies for developing the academic profile of a digital humanist.

Brian Johnsrud is currently serving as Education Curriculum Strategy Lead at Adobe. He completed a PhD at Stanford in 2009 in Modern Thought and Literature, during which time he helped launch the Poetic Media Lab with Amir Eshel. Between his time at Stanford and his current work at Adobe, Brian worked with Kahn Academy on content and curriculum development. Brian will offer perspectives on the education technology non-profit sector and strategies for pitching academic work in an industry-oriented CV.
