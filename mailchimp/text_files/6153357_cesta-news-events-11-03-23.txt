Next Week at CESTA

Maurice Lee & Brad Rittenhouse
Experimenting with Emerson (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/maurice-lee-and-brad-rittenhouse-experimenting-emerson)

Tuesday, November 7 | 12:00 - 1:15 PM | Wallenberg Hall 433A

This talk will explore the findings of Maurice and Brad's chapter in the forthcoming Oxford volume, New Approaches to Emerson, in which they apply various digital methodologies to Emersonâ€™s complicated corpus. These include several novel findings about Emerson's intellectual influences and geographic commitments that both advance and refute traditional readings of Emerson and his works.

Additionally, the talk will explore this research's unique circumstances of production. The project was completed entirely remotely during the pandemic as a collaboration between a subject specialist and a technical worker with some subject knowledge. Maurice and Brad will discuss the difficulties, opportunities, and lessons learned from this research model that is likely to become more and more common as the field of digital humanities progresses and remote work continues.

The presentation will include lunch and take place at the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis in Wallenberg 433A. A Zoom link is available upon request from Office Management Intern, Daniela Perez (perezd20@stanford.edu (mailto:perezd20@stanford.edu) ).

CESTA News & Announcements
Applications Now Open: (https://cesta.stanford.edu/students/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-research-internship-program) Undergraduate Research Internship Program (https://cesta.stanford.edu/students/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-research-internship-program)

The Undergraduate Research Internship (https://cesta.stanford.edu/students/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-research-internship-program) program empowers students to apply technologies across the Humanities and Social Sciences in ways that enhance our understanding of the world. Applications for the 2023-24 program are due November 22, 2023.

The Undergraduate Research Internship provides opportunities for undergraduates to work on CESTA research projects throughout the academic year. Through structured research training, experimentation with cutting-edge technologies, and faculty mentorship, students develop valuable academic and professional skill sets. Work on lab projects allows students to apply their developing expertise in data science, GIS, and web development in tandem with humanities skills in critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and ethical decision-making.

You can read about the experiences of recent interns in CESTA's 2022 Research Anthology (https://issuu.com/stanfordhumanities/docs/cesta_anthology_2022?fr=sN2Q0YzU2NDAzMTA) .
