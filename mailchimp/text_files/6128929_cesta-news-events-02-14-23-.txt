** Machine Reading Maps Summit (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/machine-reading-maps-summit)
------------------------------------------------------------
Thursday, April 20 - Friday, April 21

Maps constitute a significant body of global cultural heritage, and they are being scanned at a rapid pace across the Gallery, Library, Archives and Museums (GLAM) community. However, most critical investigation of maps continues on a small scale, through close readings of a few maps. Individual maps communicate through visual grammars, supplemented by text. The text found on maps, particularly in aggregate, is a nearly untapped source about the construction of knowledge about place.

Over the course of the last year, Machines Reading Maps (MRM) (https://machines-reading-maps.github.io/)  has worked with the David Rumsey Map Collection and its partner Luna Imaging to make maps searchable by their text content, creating the possibility for humanities research that uses text on maps as a primary source and transforming map collection discovery. MRM began in 2021 as a collaborative project with researchers and librarians at the University of Southern California Digital Library, the University of Minnesota, The Alan Turing Institute, as well as heritage partners at the British Library, the Library of Congress, and the National Library of Scotland.

While we speak colloquially about reading maps, MRM concretely addresses how to make text on maps an accessible resource. Spatial searching will no longer be limited to metadata fields like place of publication, or general subject, but instead will allow queries based upon the labeled, spatial content of maps.

On April 20th and 21st, 2023, The David Rumsey Map Center at Stanford University will host a gathering of the MRM x David Rumsey Map Collection extended team, faculty, library specialists, developers and select invited guests to unveil the results of the MRM x David Rumsey Map Collection work, present technical details of the process and pipelines, and seek input on the future evolution of MRM, from a project to a community supported toolkit.

News & Announcements

Mark your calendars: CESTA and CIDR will once again be co-hosting a session of digital humanities lightning talks on Tuesday, April 25, 12:00-1:15pm, to be held in-person at CESTA (a Zoom link is available upon request for remote attendance). The format is casual, with short 3-5 minute lightning talks followed by discussion and feedback from the group.

Anyone with an interest in digital humanities is invited to participate! This is a great opportunity to meet people working on similar methods or topics, get help with technical challenges, and gather ideas.

Let us know if you'd like to present a lightning talk by filling out this form (https://forms.gle/kTjJQXqxcpxvX8YV6)  by Monday, April 17. We’ll be in touch shortly after to confirm a final schedule. Please send any questions to Alix Keener (CESTA/CIDR Digital Scholarship Coordinator) at alixkee@stanford.edu (mailto:alixkee@stanford.edu) . We hope to see you there!

SoCo Humanities Research Intensive (https://soco.stanford.edu/courses/soco-humanities-research-intensive)
Elaine Treharne (English) and Caroline Winterer (History)
1 unit, September 16–22, 2023

This new, 1-week, 1-unit Sophomore College seminar will introduce you to the excitement and wonder of humanities research, while preparing you to apply for independent research grants or work as research assistant for a Stanford professor. Over five days, we’ll take a deep dive into some of the most important methods and questions driving scholarly research in the humanities. Our laboratory will be the Special Collections Library at Stanford, where we’ll conduct hands-on research in ancient and modern books, maps, objects, and manuscripts, from ancient Mesopotamian clay tablets to materials from San Francisco’s Chinatown. We’re also planning a field trip to the DeYoung Museum in San Francisco. Students who complete this course become eligible for follow-up student research grants during their next year. So if you have a larger project in mind—a capstone project, or even a senior thesis idea—this course can help set the stage for that next step.

Application deadline extended to Tuesday, April 18, 11:59 pm!
