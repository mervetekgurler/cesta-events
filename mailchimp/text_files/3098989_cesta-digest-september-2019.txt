Looking Back: CESTA Summer Internship

Each summer a new cohort of Stanford undergraduates bring their unique perspectives, backgrounds, and intellects to CESTA to conduct research in the digital humanities with faculty mentors. Thank you to all the students, faculty, and staff who made summer such a wonderful time at CESTA. We look forward to seeing you here in fall. Stay-tuned for the upcoming CESTA Research magazine, a snapshot of intern research!
