Dear CESTA friends,

With the end of the quarter upon us, we send out this last newsletter of the year, wishing everyone a good summer and looking forward to reuniting in the autumn. Before signing off for the summer, we also want to celebrate the hard work done at CESTA over the past ten months, much of it on display at the end-of-year Digital Humanities Research Showcase (on which you can read more below). We also want to introduce and welcome the summer interns who will be animating the CESTA space for ten intensive weeks starting on June 26^th—below you can read more about this amazing cohort and the projects they will be working on. You are welcome to stop by anytime this summer to say hello and see digital humanities research in action!

Warmly,

Giovanna and the CESTA team

2023 Digital Humanities Research Showcase
------------------------------------------------------------

The 2023 Digital Humanities Research Showcase was hosted at CESTA on May 26th. Every year, CESTA's Digital Humanities Fellows Program (https://cesta.stanford.edu/graduate-programs/digital-humanities-graduate-fellowship) supports graduate students developing humanities research projects that apply computational tools and methods. The day-long showcase featured talks from this year's cohort about the projects they pursued through the program. This year's showcase featured presentations from 11 unique graduate fellow projects, spanning a wide variety of disciplines, time periods and research questions. In the afternoon, CESTA hosted a poster session featuring the work of 18 of our undergraduate research interns.

Introducing the Summer '23 Undergraduate Research Interns! (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/introducing-summer-23-undergraduate-research-interns)

Introducing our Summer 2023 Interns, a community of digital humanities researchers.

The Center for Textual and Spatial Analysis at Stanford runs undergraduate research internship programs in the winter, spring, and summer quarters. Our undergraduate interns contribute to faculty projects while acquiring new skills that are consolidated in workshops and activities designed for the internship program. Our interns continue to advance digital humanities research and creating a unique community of researchers at Wallenberg Hall. You can read below about our current cohort of interns and their work. This summer, we are welcoming 21 undergraduate interns (https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/introducing-summer-23-undergraduate-research-interns)  working on 17 digital humanities research projects. This summer's full-time program is supported by two graduate mentors: Annie Lamar (https://classics.stanford.edu/people/annie-lamar)  and JJ Lugardo (https://classics.stanford.edu/people/jj-lugardo) , both PhD students in Classics.

We’re grateful to the many campus partners who support our research and programs, including colleagues at Stanford University Libraries and the Stanford Humanities Center.  Our Undergraduate Research Internship program receives generous support from a VPUE Departmental Grant. Some projects and interns at CESTA are also supported by Changing Human Experience Grants, departmental funds, and faculty research funds.
