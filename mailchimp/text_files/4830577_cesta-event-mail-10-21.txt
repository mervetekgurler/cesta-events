CESTA SEMINAR SERIES
"The Business of Debt: A Digital Investigation of Municipal Bonds and Inequality"
Online, via Zoom. Register here (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUoc-6vqTMpGt0s-en5DdmnuADQPyCydI19)

About this talk: The Business of Debt offers a visual analysis of the changing scope of the municipal bond business from the early moments of the Great Depression to the 1980s, a decade described by city officials, bankers, and others as one of tremendous chaos. By data visualization methods, the project moves from one period of precarity to another, documenting, in the years between, the remarkable growth of a tight-knit profession of bankers and bond attorneys. Ultimately, it helps users see that the bond market was made not through supply and demand or other autonomous forces, but by a relatively small group of identifiable people who bought, sold, held, and resold debt, and who helped turn cities into tax-exempt investment vehicles.

November 9, 6PM  Kathryn Starkey & Mae Velloso-Lyons
DH PUBLIC LECTURE
"Building the Global Medieval Sourcebook: Around the World in 200 Texts!"
Online, via Zoom. Register here (https://stanford.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_YlkC9wXTRHitx69ybQWIJQ)

About this talk: How did medieval people think about love, death, and their own place in history? What did they think was funny? These are some of the questions explored by our project, which brings together stories, poems, jokes and other texts from Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and the Americas. In this lecture, we introduce texts that have never been translated into English before. We also talk about how new technologies can be harnessed to bring research to new audiences, and about the necessity, and challenges, of presenting a global view of the Middle Ages.

CESTA SEMINAR SERIES
"Reframing and Truthfulness in the Digital Repository"
Online, via Zoom. Register here (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEvcuCgrDwjEt1HmJv9IR8yrRZdLt3wcN86)

About this talk: Manuscripts and other cultural heritage materials have always been depicted in different ways to increase access and for analysis. The digital repository is one of a long line of representational frameworks, including printed woodcuts, painted facsimiles, black and white photographs and analog color images. Every format has its own strategies for truthfulness of representation and for signaling interpretive norms. This talk stems from work undertaken on the Medieval Fragments Study Collection at Stanford University Libraries. It follows the framing of the collection from physical folders holding the fragments, to finding aids, to the online catalog, analyzing how these remodalizations emphasize different aspects of the discourse of the archive with the help of concepts from social semiotics.

Applications are now open for the Digital Humanities Graduate Fellowship!

The fellowship will run from January to June 2022 and supports graduate students to produce publishable research using DH methods and approaches. The support of a research assistant will be available to all fellows.
