Tomorrow at CESTA, 9AM-12PM:  Transcribathon!
https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/early-modern-recipe-online-collective-transcribathon
Friday, November 4| 9 AM-12 PM | Wallenberg Hall Rm 433A
About this event: Join CESTA and the Stanford Department of Anthropology to take part in the Early Modern Recipe Online Colellective's annual transcribathon (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/early-modern-recipe-online-collective-transcribathon) on Friday Nov 4. We're going to be making searchable transcriptions of two 17th century recipe books (one medical, and one cookery) with a community of scholars all around the world. It's a great opportunity to learn about paleography, 17th century food and medicine, and female knowledge networks, and to get some experience working with archival documents.

No experience is needed, just drop in to CESTA any time between 9am and 12pm and bring a laptop if possible. The main event will be followed by a tour of the recipe books in Stanford Special Collections starting at 12.15pm.

This event is co-sponsored by CESTA and the Department of Anthropology. (https://anthropology.stanford.edu/)
