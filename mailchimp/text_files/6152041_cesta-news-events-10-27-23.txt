Next Week at CESTA

Alan Liu & Roopika Risam
Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series: The Place of Data (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/mellon-sawyer-seminar-series-place-data-alan-liu-and-roopika-risam)

Thursday, November 2 | 5:30-7:00 PM | Terrace Room, Margaret Jacks Hall (460)

Setting the stage for our future Mellon Sawyer Seminar discussions, The Place of Data will explore the various axes along which data has engendered the divisions that shape our current world. Whether those divisions lie along fault lines in geography, race, gender, or discipline, our initial seminar will situate our thinking about data within this complex web of cultural intersections. What dangers attend the use of data across these divisions and how might we use data itself to redress these concerns?

This is the first event in the Mellon Sawyer Seminar series, The Data that Divides Us: Recalibrating Data Methods for New Knowledge Frameworks Across the Humanities, generously funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. During Stanford University's 2023-24 academic year, the Sawyer Seminar Series will convene scholars from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and personal standpoints to discuss the data that has saturated our world.

The seminar will feature remarks from Prof. Alan Liu (Univerity of California, Santa Barbara) and Prof. Roopika Risam (Dartmouth) and a response from Prof. Mark Algee-Hewitt (Stanford). The event will be preceded by a reception at 5:00 p.m. in the Terrace Room of Margaret Jacks Hall (Bldg. 460). A Zoom link is available upon request from Office Management Intern, Daniela Perez (perezd20@stanford.edu (mailto:perezd20@stanford.edu) ).

CESTA News & Announcements


** New in CESTA: DH Book Collection (http:/https://cesta.stanford.edu/news/new-cesta-dh-book-collection)
------------------------------------------------------------

The next time you stop by CESTA, take a look at the bookshelves across from our coffee station: you'll see a newly refreshed collection of DH reference titles for your enjoyment while in the center, as well as a growing collection of faculty/CESTA affiliate books. We have both old and new titles on a diverse range of topics--thanks to input from CESTA staff and graduate and undergraduate students--from Berry's Understanding Digital Humanities, D'Ignazio and Klein's Data Feminism, Drucker's The Digital Humanities Coursebook, Risam's The Digital Black Atlantic, and lots more.

If it's been a while since you visited, we have also added a new cozy reading nook with plenty of comfortable chairs and lamps in the back area of CESTA. It's the perfect spot to kick back or take a break from your day to peruse some digital humanities literature. We hope to see you enjoying these books in CESTA soon!
Applications Now Open: The Digital Humanities Fellows Program (https://cesta.stanford.edu/graduate-programs/digital-humanities-fellows-program)

Over two quarters (Winter and Spring), fellows will enter a community of practice that features workshops with special guests tailored to the needs of the cohort, works-in-progress presentations from fellows, and guidance from scholars and practitioners across campus. Each DH Fellow will benefit from two quarters of support from an undergraduate research intern whose interests and expertise closely align with the research project.

To foster a community of practice, fellows gather for weekly meetings with their cohort. The program of meetings typically includes:
* Skills workshops
* Seminars from DH practitioners
* Works-in-progress presentations
* Graduate reading group

Learn about last year's cohort (https://cesta.stanford.edu/people/dh-fellows)  or see the full list of fellows' projects (https://cesta.stanford.edu/graduate-programs/alumni) .
Applications Now Open: (https://cesta.stanford.edu/students/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-research-internship-program) Undergraduate Research Internship Program (https://cesta.stanford.edu/students/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-research-internship-program)

The Undergraduate Research Internship (https://cesta.stanford.edu/students/undergraduate-programs/undergraduate-research-internship-program) program empowers students to apply technologies across the Humanities and Social Sciences in ways that enhance our understanding of the world. Applications for the 2023-24 program are due November 22, 2023.

The Undergraduate Research Internship provides opportunities for undergraduates to work on CESTA research projects throughout the academic year. Through structured research training, experimentation with cutting-edge technologies, and faculty mentorship, students develop valuable academic and professional skill sets. Work on lab projects allows students to apply their developing expertise in data science, GIS, and web development in tandem with humanities skills in critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and ethical decision-making.

You can read about the experiences of recent interns in CESTA's 2022 Research Anthology (https://issuu.com/stanfordhumanities/docs/cesta_anthology_2022?fr=sN2Q0YzU2NDAzMTA) .

Sign Up to Receive RDO's New Arts & Humanities Funding Newsletter (https://mailchi.mp/832f2630bd33/welcome-to-rdos-new-arts-humanities-funding-newsletter)

Stanford's Research and Development Office is circulating a new newsletter, dedicated to sharing opportunities for Arts and Humanities funding. This newsletter will be organized in three sections to make it easy to determine what is most relevant to you:
* News and Updates will highlight topics of immediate relevance to Stanford’s arts and humanities faculty and staff—including internal research development resources, news from funders, event announcements, and colleagues’ funding wins.
* External Funding Opportunities will feature open funding programs with deadlines within the next few months. To make it easier to skim for changes, I will clearly indicate which opportunities have been added since last month’s newsletter.
* Stanford Funding Opportunities will feature open internal funding programs that support Stanford faculty research and creative work, again with recently added opportunities clearly marked.

Please share this newsletter with anyone you feel would benefit from receiving this information. They can subscribe here (https://stanford.us13.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=3102bb24f58b90bf35ff83e1b&id=1cdfa3a07a) to receive future installments.You can also reach out to mdpriest@stanford.edu (mailto:mdpriest@stanford.edu?subject=&body=) if you’re considering pursuing any of the funding opportunities, if you’re interested in learning more about support for grant-seeking in these fields, or if you have suggestions for what you’d like to see here in the future.
