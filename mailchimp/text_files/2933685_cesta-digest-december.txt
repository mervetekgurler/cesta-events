With the arrival of the Holidays comes the closure of Stanford Campus for students, faculty, and staff. CESTA will be closed for break starting December 22nd. We'll open for the new year and Winter quarter Janauary 7th.

Until then, have a safe and very Happy Holiday season!

CESTA is pleased to host Anna Foka from December 1st through the 13th. Dr. Foka is Scientific Leader of the Digital Humanities Initiative at the Institute for Archives, Museums and Libraries (ABM) Uppsala University, and Associate Professor in Information Technology and the Humanities at Humlab, Umeå University, Sweden. Her research interests lie in the intersection of digital technology with historical disciplines. She has published on classics,  ancient history and archaeology, gender and humour, classical reception, game studies, augmented and virtual reality for museums, digital visualizations and geography. Her latest project investigates movement, transformation, and crisis through the prisms of digital technology and ancient history.

New GIS Cartography Resources Website

David Medeiros of the Stanford Geospatial Center has assembled resources for map design to help students interested in making their maps better tools for effective communication. The new SGC GIS Cartography site has a large link list to pages on a variety of topics from general design advice to specific tips or tutorials on map design topics like color, symbology, labelling etc. There are also links to design tutorials as well as useful design focused web apps and software tools (mostly free). And finally links to great map design inspiration from the blogs and postings of some of the best digital cartographers working today.

Thanks for this putting together this awesome collection David!
