Eric Harvey

"Beyond Compliance: Thinking Accessibly about the Digital Humanities"
Online, via Zoom. Register here (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJcsdumrqzMoG9SHrQ5M6jiDRitgAq64A-EZ) .

About this talk: Equal access to digital tools and media can only be ensured if they are created with accessibility in mind. Too often, accessibility can seem like a burden and be left to the final moments, if not neglected entirely. This talk will show that thinking about data and digital publication from the outset leads not only to better experiences for disabled users, but also to deeper, more fully developed, and more flexible projects overall. This talk will present a broad theoretical framework for universal and inclusive thinking, with reference to specific tools and resources to guide accessible development.

About the speaker: Eric Harvey is CESTA’s Digital Humanities Postdoctoral Fellow. He earned his Ph.D. in Near Eastern and Judaic Studies from Brandeis University in 2020 with his dissertation “Sing to the Lord a New(-ish) Song: The Psalms of the Egyptian Hallel Across Two Thousand Years.” His research combines Book History, Material Philology, and Evolutionary Biology to reconceptualize Hebrew Psalms over the longue durée. He also researches disability in antiquity and advocates for accessibility in digital tools and resources. He keeps a personal site with blog and accessibility resources at www.blindscholar.com (https://www.blindscholar.com/) .

Digital Horizons, a new CESTA/SHC lecture series, will launch on April 5, 2022, with a talk by Sylvester Johnson:

Will Intelligent Machines Become Human? The History of the Fetish, the Future of the Cyborg, and Necropolitics

Tuesday, April 5, 2022. 4:00-6:00PM PST.

From Aristotle’s ancient conception of the soul to Ibn Rushd’s 12th-century analytics of the intellect to the information theory underlying neural networks, scholars have queried the agency of things and the relationship between matter and its other (spirit?). Does agency inhere in material things? Can an assemblage of machine parts be a person? What distinguishes humans from mere objects? In this talk, Sylvester Johnson takes up these questions and proposes that the use of intelligent machines (in the form of artificial intelligence or machine-learning applications) for human enhancement has crystallized these age-old conundrums in a new key.
