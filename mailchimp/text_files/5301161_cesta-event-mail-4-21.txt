DH Careers: Beyond Academia
Alexis Charles, Erin Glass, George Philip LeBordais, Max Suechting, and Steel Wagstaff
Online via Zoom. Register for Zoom attendance here. (https://stanford.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_rQbVtNKMTWueLy0Nmj5_Zg)

This panel showcases careers beyond academia in fields which share an affinity with the digital humanities, including digital publishing, educational technology, and software development. Our panelists, whose roles span product management to program development to content production, all chose to pursue PhDs in the humanities and then to build their professional future in industry. We'll hear about their paths into their current positions, the day-to-day of their current work, and what graduate students hoping to follow in their footsteps need to know.

Our panelists:

Alexis Charles, Learning Program Manager at Meta
PhD in Modern Thought and Literature, Stanford University

Erin Glass, Manager of Developer Education at Digital Ocean
PhD in English with Certificate in Interactive Technology and Pedagogy, CUNY

George Philip LeBordais, Head of Partnerships at Polygence
PhD in Art History, Stanford University

Max Suechting, K12 Content Lead at Adobe for Education
PhD Candidate in Modern Thought and Literature, Stanford University

Steel Wagstaff, Product Manager at Pressbooks
PhD in English and MLIS, University of Wisconsin

DH Careers is a quarterly panel series showcasing the many professional paths for graduates with training in the digital humanities. You can watch our previous panels here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAw1vpXPU9A)  and here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9A5fshDXg0) . This series is primarily intended for current graduate students and early career researchers but is open to anyone who registers, regardless of institutional affiliation or career stage.

Day of DH 2022!
Day of DH 2022 (https://stanford.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d3edfb9438089c6e3817bee4d&id=7ff430fc85&e=dcee313e6d)  is happening Thursday, April 28th! This is an annual global event (organized by centerNet) where digital humanists around the world share what they do with the community.

We invite you to stop by CESTA from 9:00-10:30am for a kickoff breakfast to meet, mingle, visit the space, or even hang out and get a little work done. Then from 2:30-4:00pm, Alix Keener, Digital Scholarship Coordinator in CESTA, will have open DH office hours to answer questions about DH tools and methods, digital publishing, and anything else on your mind. Annie Lamar and Merve Tekgurler, 2021-22 graduate mentors for the URI (https://stanford.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d3edfb9438089c6e3817bee4d&id=773dc62b31&e=dcee313e6d) program at CESTA, will also be there and ready to answer questions about what undergraduate students can do at CESTA.

We’ll be tweeting about our activities throughout the day using the hashtag #DayofDH2022, and we encourage you to do the same!

Please get in touch with Alix (alixkee@stanford.edu (mailto:alixkee@stanford.edu) ) with any questions.
Critical Data Practices Workshop
Friday, April 29, 2022. 9:00-10:00PM PT.
The Problem of Missing Data
In collaboration with the School for Advanced Study
Online event. Registration and Zoom link (https://forms.gle/ZPicmJttqcD7pYYP8) .
Can the quantity of data ever make up for its quality? What can we do about data that is necessarily incomplete, or where the incompleteness of the data is precisely what gives it its scholarly interest? How do we engage with vast quantities of data without losing sight of what’s been excluded—systemically, deliberately, or by happenstance—from the archive?

Chair: Jane Winters (Professor, Digital Humanities) Discussants: Caio Mello (Doctoral Researcher, Digital Humanities), Amara Thornton (Co-Investigator and Research Fellow, Classics), Anna-Maria Sichani (Post-Doctoral Research Associate, Digital Humanities), Naomi Wells (Lecturer, Modern Languages and Digital Humanities).
Reframing Enslaved Pasts Series
Thursday, April 28, 2022. 10:00-11:00AM PDT.
Stanford Global Studies presents:
Reframing Enslaved Pasts
The Registers of Slave Liberation in Colonial Senegal
Online via Zoom. Open to all. Register here (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwscuyrrD8uGdCIDShaFuXNCSAk9WQiJO3p) .
The “Reframing enslaved pasts (https://sgs.stanford.edu/news-eventsevents/global-research-workshops) ” series discusses critical data practices around enslaved pasts, focusing on the methods and choices that underlie digital data projects.

SPEAKERS
Babacar Fall (founding director of the Institut d’Études Avancées)
Richard Roberts (Frances and Charles Field Professor of History, Emeritus, Stanford)
Ibrahima Seck (Associate Professor, History, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar and Research Director, Whitney Plantation, Louisiana)
Sarina Rye (freshman research assistant, Stanford)
Rebecca Wall (Visiting Assistant Professor, History, Hamilton College)

ABOUT THE TALK
The Senegal Liberations Project (SLP) (http://www.senegalliberationsproject.com/)  is a collaborative project between Stanford University, the Institut d’Études Avancées in Saint Louis (Senegal), the National Archives of Senegal, and Hamilton College. The SLP is based on making available to researchers and students a unique register of the liberations of nearly 30,000 enslaved people in Senegal between 1857 and May 1903. It builds on and complements previous initiatives including the Slave Voyages Database (https://www.slavevoyages.org/) through a focus on dynamics of enslavement and liberation within West Africa. The SLP differs from other studies of liberated Africans in the sense that the enslaved people in these registers actively sought their own “freedom.” We will share a preliminary analysis of 10,000 enslaved Africans who obtained formal liberation in Senegal from 1894 to 1903. Following this, we will raise some of the primary historiographic and methodological possibilities raised
by this project.
