How a Pandemic Becomes a Story: Narrative and Social Crisis in the Platform Age

About this event: As the COVID-19 pandemic winds down, critics and scholars have begun to ask: how will culture (fiction, film, TV) memorialize this massive social crisis? What will be the COVID-19 "narrative?" However, since early 2020, tens of thousands of ordinary online users, on popular writing platforms like Wattpad, have been writing about COVID-19 (i.e. #Covid) in real time. This talk combines computational and critical methods, leveraging the affordances of Internet data, to study how individuals internalized COVID-19 by writing stories about it, ad hoc and before anyone knew how the story would end. What kinds of stories did they write? What kinds of social worlds did they imagine? How did those stories evolve over time, as the world learned more about the pandemic? More broadly, this talk reflects on the impact of new writing platforms on how we understand the relationship between writing and social representation, models rooted traditionally in pre-Internet print culture. How
are such platforms changing what it means to narrate a social event? How is user generated content impacting traditional publishing—how is #Covid19 anticipating the novels, films, and TV shows to come?

About this series: The Digital Horizons Lecture series is co-presented by the Stanford Humanities Center (https://shc.stanford.edu/) and the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (https://cesta.stanford.edu/)  (CESTA).

October 4 | 4-6 PM | SHC Levinthal Hall (https://goo.gl/maps/h8H6hzht9T6oucjk6)  and online (https://stanford.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_j5JW3-ELTr6spJ-QTh2_2A)

Computation and Culture in the Era of Digital Media: A Transdisciplinary Roundtable

About this event:

How do recent developments in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in the area of large language models, challenge existing disciplinary specializations, practices, and boundaries? How does it change how we understand culture, literature and communication? How might future advances in NLP change our relationship to language, meaning, and one another?

A transdisciplinary roundtable will consider these questions and more. The roundtable will feature:
* Mark McGurl (https://english.stanford.edu/people/mark-mcgurl) , Albert Guérard Professor of Literature, Stanford University
* Xiaochang Li (https://sts.stanford.edu/people/xiaochang-li) , Assistant Professor, Department of Communication, Stanford University
* Richard Jean So (https://www.mcgill.ca/english/staff/richard-jean-so) , Associate Professor, Department of English, McGill University
* Diyi Yang (https://profiles.stanford.edu/diyi-yang) , Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science, Stanford University

Moderated by Will Fenton (https://profiles.stanford.edu/william-fenton) , Associate Director of Research at the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis. Informal reception to follow.
October 5 | 5-6.30 PM | Wallenberg 433A
Critical Data Practices Symposium
What are the unique challenges that face the humanities as we ground data-driven insights in real-world human complexity, and in various social, cultural, and historical contexts? Digitization and computational methods provide new opportunities for understanding the cultural implications of data, its meaning, and its significance to the long history of recorded human experience. We must therefore carefully consider the ways that we derive meaning from data through critical attention to methods and sources—our critical data practices. With this symposium, which we organize around a number of questions raised by working with data in the humanities, we aim to join the threads of the general and the specific, the diachronic and synchronic, and to create a space in which what Lorraine Daston called the “hidden affinities” between disciplines becomes perceptible.

October 6 | 5-6 PM   Opening Session
This opening session will feature brief presentations from Mark Algee-Hewitt (https://english.stanford.edu/people/mark-algee-hewitt)  (Associate Professor of English), Giovanna Ceserani  (https://classics.stanford.edu/people/giovanna-ceserani) (CESTA Faculty Director and Associate Professor of Classics), Laura Stokes (https://history.stanford.edu/people/laura-stokes)  (Associate Professor of History) and remarks by Debra Satz (https://philosophy.stanford.edu/people/debra-satz)  (Dean of the School of H&S) and Peter Leonard (https://profiles.stanford.edu/peter-leonard)  (Assistant University Librarian).
Wallenberg 433A. Reception to follow.
October 7 | 9 AM-5 PM   Panel Sessions
Participants include David Bamman, Sean Fraga, Merit MacArthur, Miriam Posner, Rachel Scarborough King, Danny Snelson, and Elaine Treharne. The full schedule will be posted to our website (https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/critical-data-practices-symposium) .
