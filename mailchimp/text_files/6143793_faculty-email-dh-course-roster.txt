Dear CESTA Colleagues,
I’m working to put together a roster of Digital Humanities courses for our ever-growing DH Minor for the 2023-24 AY.  As many of you know, students are keen to learn from us how to combine humanistic thinking and inquiry with technological skills and digital know-how.  The DH Minor appeals to students wanting to experiment with these approaches outside Majors that don’t always offer that kind of self-designed (and eclectic) cross-disciplinary reach.  I’ll be organizing a large promotional push this fall to get the word out about both Digital Humanities and the opportunities of pursuing the DH Minor, but I need your help to collate our offerings.
Please email me (staveley@stanford.edu (mailto:staveley@stanford.edu) ) a list of any courses you are teaching this year which I could feature, especially if they might fulfill our Core areas: Quantitative Text Analysis, Geospatial Humanities, and Text Technologies.  One change I’ve initiated this year is that the Core course can be taken for 4 (not 5) units.  Even if you think your course doesn’t fulfill the Core, I am eager to newly feature elective courses on our website https://dhminor.stanford.edu/elective-courses, so do also alert me to those.  I can support and help direct students into your classes whether they fulfill core or elective categories.
If your course does count towards the DH Minor in any way, I’d also be grateful if you might put that information on your syllabi.  I will soon distribute updated pamphlets, posters, and digital fliers about it.
Please don’t hesitate to contact me (staveley@stanford.edu (mailto:staveley@stanford.edu) ) if you’d like to know more, or just to brainstorm ideas about the DH Minor and/or designing your pedagogy with it in mind.
Best wishes,
Alice
