These span people with disabilities being unable to read COVID-19 infographics to them being excluded from digital networks like social media and remote meetings which frequently and rapidly transmit highly visual information. One approach to increasing nonvisual access to information for people who are blind and low vision is artificial intelligence (AI), which promises automation and scalability.

Cynthia Bennett : ""Centering People in Information Translation"" About this talk : Inaccessible information has wide-ranging consequences. These span people with disabilities being unable to read COVID-19 infographics to them being excluded from digital networks like social media and remote meetings which frequently and rapidly transmit highly visual information. One approach to increasing nonvisual access to information for people who are blind and low vision is artificial intelligence (AI), which promises automation and scalability. However, research and media reports continue to illuminate AI-bias and malicious applications. As these harms tend to impact people who already experience marginalization, the ethics of applying AI to solve perennial accessibility challenges is complicated. In this talk I will overview one project I led concerning one facet of information accessibility—how people are represented in human and AI-generated alternative (alt) text descriptions. I will share findings from interviews I conducted with blind people who rely on alt text to understand visual information and who also identified as a minoritized race or gender shown to be disproportionately misrepresented by AI-powered human recognition systems. From their experiences and perspectives, I synthesized alt text design considerations. However, I will conclude the talk with provocations for the audience, rooted in examples from art and disability activism, which ask us to move beyond future systems which invisibly automate alt text production to reveal and reimagine human-centered methods for interpreting visual content into nonvisual formats. About the speaker: Cynthia Bennett is a Postdoctoral Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute. Her HCI research concerns the intersection of power, disability, and design. Bennett is regularly invited to speak about her research; recent hosts include the Goethe-Institut and\xa0 The Radical AI podcast. She has received funding from the National Science Foundation, Microsoft Research, and the University of Washington’s Human Centered Design and Engineering department, where she completed her Ph.D. She has published in top-tier human-computer interaction venues, and seven of these papers have received awards. Respondent: Roanne Kantor , Assistant Professor of English (Stanford University)', 'Nicholas Giudice | Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis Abstract:\xa0In this talk, I will discuss challenges with current approaches of data visualization (maps, figures, graphs), arguing that traditional practices are often exclusionary and outdated with respect to (1) an understanding of human information processing in the brain and (2) the technologies and user interfaces they use. We will discuss how most ‘visual’ information underlying what is visualized is really ‘spatial’ information and that all of our senses are able to convey spatial information. Nicholas Giudice Abstract: In this talk, I will discuss challenges with current approaches of data visualization (maps, figures, graphs), arguing that traditional practices are often exclusionary and outdated with respect to (1) an understanding of human information processing in the brain and (2) the technologies and user interfaces they use. We will discuss how most ‘visual’ information underlying what is visualized is really ‘spatial’ information and that all of our senses are able to convey spatial information. This opens the door for the efficacy and merit of multisensory approaches to data visualization, which will be discussed in terms of underlying theory related to how spatial information from different senses is processed in the brain and how modern user interfaces can support this new form of visualization. The key take home message is that we need to move beyond vision-only visualizations and that multisensory approaches are not only more accessible and inclusive, but they also model how our brain actually works. Some practical examples will be shared from my research, with the hope of generating discussion. About the speaker: Dr. Nicholas Giudice received his Ph.D. in the Cognitive and Brain Sciences program from the University of Minnesota in 2004. He is currently Professor of Spatial Computing in the School of Computing and Information Science at the University of Maine and founder and Chief Research Scientist of UMaine’s Virtual Environments and Multimodal Interaction (VEMI) Lab ( https://umaine.edu/vemi ). Nicholas’s research focuses on the design and evaluation of bio-inspired multisensory technology supporting graphical access, navigation with and without vision, and autonomous vehicle accessibility. His work is aimed at increasing information access and independence for blind and visually impaired (BVI) people, older adults experiencing visual impairment, and sighted folks in eyes-free situations. He is himself congenitally blind and has a long history of both designing and using assistive technologies. Dr. Giudice has published over 150 scientific papers in these areas, advised over 100 graduate and undergraduate students, and collaborated on over $15 million in research grants in this field from NIH, NSF, and NIDILRR. He is on the board of directors of two blindness-related organizations (The Iris Network and ACB of Maine), the editorial board of two accessibility journals (Transactions on Accessible Computing and Assistive Technology), the scientific advisory board of two information-access companies (Aira Tech Corp and Click&Go wayfinding maps), and is the co-founder and Chief Research Officer of UNAR Labs, a Maine-based start-up company designing innovative multisensory technologies promoting inclusive information access.

Before the advent of modern cartography, the itinerary was the height of geographic knowledge. Lists of cities and their relative distances opened European travel to a broad readership. By the mid-sixteenth century, private and public individuals carried such guides to navigate state networks of mounted couriers and staging posts. The itinerary database offers the ability to model a European “mental map,” preserving important directionality, hierarchization, and structural change over time. Using the case studies of Rome, Lyon, and London, I provide new periodization for changing European space in early modern print.

Dr. Rowan Dorin, Thawsitt Naing, and Clara Romani will present: ""Corpus Synodalium: Mapping Law (and Resistance) in Late Medieval Europe"" Abstract: The bishops of late medieval Europe issued thousands of laws, on subjects ranging from the regulation of midwives to the tithing of livestock, and even on what to do if a spider fell into the communion wine. Yet despite the value ofthis legal corpus as a source for the social and religious history of the late Middle Ages, its sheer scale (to say nothingof the challenges of scattered manuscripts, indecipherable handwriting, linguistic variety, and messy textual trans-mission) has long deterred scholars from exploiting its riches. In this talk, we will present Corpus Synodalium, a new online database that gathers together the extant corpus of medieval episcopal legislation into a user-friendly platform that supports a range of text analysis tools as well as an innovative mapping function. The talk will be of particular interest to scholars working with non-English or multilingual sources, as well as those seeking to integrate spatial visualizations into textual research. Bios: Rowan Dorin has been an Assistant Professor of History at Stanford since 2017, and is the project leader for the Corpus Synodalium project. His research and teaching focus primarily on western Europe and the Mediterranean during the Middle Ages (500-1500 CE), and he is currently working on two books, the first exploring the rise of mass expulsion\xa0in late medieval Europe, and the second examining the ways in which religious law was adapted or resisted in local contexts in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. He has also published articles on Mediterranean trade networks, crusader art, and the production of medieval manuscripts. Thawsitt Naing is a recent Stanford CS grad (class of 2019). He was the lead developer for the Corpus Synodalium database and mapping visualization websites. Currently, he is working on building delightful and accessible user interfaces at ThoughtSpot. Clara Romani is a senior double majoringin History and French with a minor in Italian. She has been delighted to work on the mapping end of Corpus Synoda- lium project for the past two and a half years, and is currently beginning her own research with an honor’s thesis on Medieval French History.

Prof. Elaine Treharne: Near and Far: Medieval Manuscripts Through Digital Time and Space This lecture will investigate the lives of medieval manuscripts and fragments that date from the late sixth century to the fifteenth century, tracing their survival to the present day, when increasing numbers exist online in digital format. The benefits to scholars of digitization are incalculable, especially in a time of global pandemic when it is impossible to view manuscripts in person. But what do we see when we work with manuscripts and fragments in online form only? What are the advantages and what are the challenges of new technologies for viewing books produced by hand as new forms of data? This lecture is a call to maximise the opportunities of the digital environment, while being aware of the essential skills and expertise required to make the most of access to these incredible resources. Participants can expect a rich and diverse range of images and ideas as we look at how manuscripts become data, and data becomes new knowledge. About the Speaker :\xa0Elaine Treharne, MArAd, PhD, FSA, FRHistS, FEA, FLSW, is the Roberta Bowman Denning Professor of Humanities, Professor of English, and Robert K. Packard University Fellow in Undergraduate Education at Stanford University. She is a medieval literature and manuscript specialist, with expertise in the long history of human communication and archival studies. She has published over thirty books and sixty articles, mostly focused on Early English texts in their manuscript contexts, and also on the digital aspect of early textuality. She directs Stanford Text Technologies, which investigates the potential of data analysis for the study of historical knowledge production. She is interested in the record of human experience: how it is transmitted, who is remembered, and how the past is memorialised. Her newest books include Text Technologies: A History , with Claude Willan (Stanford University Press, 2019); the Cambridge Companion to British Medieval Manuscripts , ed. with Orietta Da Rold (CUP, 2020); and Perceptions of Medieval Manuscripts: The Phenomenal Book (OUP, 2021).', 'CESTA Seminar Series with Agnieszka Backman | Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis Please join us Tuesday, October 22,\xa0in\xa0the\xa0seminar\xa0room at\xa0CESTA\xa0(Bldg. 160, Rm. 433A)\xa0from\xa012:00–1:00pm\xa0for\xa0the\xa0third lecture in our fall quarter\xa0CESTA\xa0Seminar\xa0Series.\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0 Dr. Agnieszka Backman\xa0will present:\xa0\xa0 ""Using Socio Semiotic Analysis on Medieval Manuscript Platforms"" \xa0 CESTA Seminar Series with Agnieszka Backman Please join us Tuesday , October 22, in\xa0the\xa0seminar\xa0room at CESTA\xa0(Bldg. 160, Rm. 433A) from 12:00–1:00pm for\xa0the\xa0third lecture in our fall quarter CESTA Seminar Series .  Dr. Agnieszka Backman will present: ""Using Socio Semiotic Analysis on Medieval Manuscript Platforms""  Abstract:\xa0\xa0Digitizing medieval manuscripts is often advertised as a way to make them more accessible, but it also changes what you can do with them. Using socio semiotic theory and method I will be doing a multimodal analysis of three platforms containing medieval Swedish manuscripts, Alvin (Alvin-portal.org), Handrit.is, and Manuscripta.se, as a first step to study the affordances of these platforms. Affordances, what a design allows you to do, are often discussed when it comes to platforms with medieval manuscripts but are seldom defined or analyzed in any detail. Digital affordances frame manuscripts differently than physical collections and the three platforms are examples of how different perspectives and software solutions impact the meaning potential of manuscripts. About the speaker: Agnieszka Backman is a new Wallenberg Postdoctoral Fellow working in Text Technologies. Her project is on materialities of medieval manuscripts on digital platforms from a multimodal, socio semiotic perspective. By comparing the affordances of physical manuscripts vs. digitized ones, she will show the effects digitization has on the meaning of manuscripts. Agnieszka finished her PhD on the materiality of a Swedish medieval manuscript, D 3, also called Fru Elin’s bok ‘Lady Elin’s book’, in 2017 at Uppsala University. For the last two years she has worked in The Norse perception of the world project ( www.uu.se/norseworld ), which is mapping foreign place names in medieval Swedish and Danish vernacular texts.

Dr. Mateusz Fafinski will present: Cartographies of Text: Unstructured Historical Textual Data and Maps Abstract: Working on large sets of historical documents (corpora of charters, sets of chronicles, letters etc.) poses many challenges similar to working with big data. Visualizing results of analyses of such sets on maps and linking texts with images is essential for creating new interpretative possibilities. Such practice also creates new layers of meaning, where digital facsimiles coexist with source texts and commentaries in cartographical space. But curated, interactive maps of corpora offer not only possibilities but also pose challenges. Pre-structuring data sets limits the usability of the end product for research. Moving from theoretical questions about pre-structuring data to practical examples of work on mapping Anglo-Saxon charters, we will try together to see whether it is possible to approach large historical data sets in a more flexible and interactive manner. About the speaker:', 'Machine Reading Maps Summit | Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis Maps constitute a significant body of global cultural heritage, and they are being scanned at a rapid pace across the Gallery, Library, Archives and Museums (GLAM) community. However, most critical investigation of maps continues on a small scale, through\xa0close\xa0readings\xa0of a few maps. Individual maps communicate through visual grammars, supplemented by text.

However, most critical investigation of maps continues on a small scale, through close readings of a few maps. Individual maps communicate through visual grammars, supplemented by text. The text found on maps, particularly in aggregate, is a nearly untapped source about the construction of knowledge about place. Over the course of the last year, Machines Reading Maps (MRM) has worked with the David Rumsey Map Collection and its partner Luna Imaging to make maps searchable by their text content, creating the possibility for humanities research that uses text on maps as a primary source and transforming map collection discovery. MRM began in 2021 as a collaborative project with researchers and librarians at the University of Southern California Digital Library, the University of Minnesota, The Alan Turing Institute, as well as heritage partners at the British Library, the Library of Congress, and the National Library of Scotland. While we speak colloquially about reading maps, MRM concretely addresses how to make text on maps an accessible resource. Spatial searching will no longer be limited to metadata fields like place of publication, or general subject, but instead will allow queries based upon the labeled, spatial content of maps. On April 20th and 21st, 2023, The David Rumsey Map Center at Stanford University will host a gathering of the MRM x David Rumsey Map Collection extended team, faculty, library specialists, developers and select invited guests to unveil the results of the MRM x David Rumsey Map Collection work, present technical details of the process and pipelines, and seek input on the future evolution of MRM, from a project to a community supported toolkit.

This talk, presented by Nicholas Jenkins (PI on the in-progress Kindred London digital humanities project) and\xa0Erik Steiner (Co-Director of\xa0the Spatial History Project at CESTA), focuses on a new\xa0map of London’s neighborhoods that Jenkins and Steiner have created for use in Kindred London . The Steiner-Jenkins map is an effort to identify and outline\xa0some 260 neighborhoods of London,\xa0giving a new set of shapes and forms to the city’s districts as identified by daily experience and collective understanding. The map,\xa0part tool and part artwork, the\xa0product of both\xa0research and imagination, draws on a wide range of printed sources,\xa0social\xa0media, administrative data, colloquial descriptions, commercial mapping sites\xa0and personal accounts. The result is a “soft city”, a representation of space that (like all maps) draws lines and edges. But the visual forms in play here are\xa0biomorphic not jagged, softly\xa0curved not angular, and the Steiner-Jenkins map tries to\xa0embrace the\xa0human reality of overlapping definitions of place and of perceptual uncertainties. Modern mapping systems thrive on a claim to being comprehensive, objective\xa0and absolute. But culturally-defined places, like those which are the subject of the Steiner-Jenkins map, are spatially contentious, defined from the bottom-up, and evolving. What is more, they don’t conform to\xa0the invisible barriers\xa0put up by administrative definitions of space (census blocks,\xa0precincts, zip\xa0codes). Neighborhood definitions are\xa0democratic, mutable and subjective; as such, they play a major role in organizing citizens\' behavior. For these reasons, the Steiner-Jenkins biomorphic map of London\xa0brings into view important disciplinary questions about subjectivity, ambiguity and the aesthetic within the field of the\xa0spatial\xa0humanities. Nicholas Jenkins is the Primary Investigator for the forthcoming Kindred London and for Kindred Britain , described by the Economist as ""an amazing digital humanities website that traces relations between 30,000 British people.” He has edited a Lincoln Kirstein Reader and co-edited and contributed to three volumes of Oxford University Press\'s ""Auden Studies"" series. Erik Steiner is the co-director and co-founder of the Spatial\xa0History Project at the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA).\xa0A former\xa0President of the North American\xa0Cartographic Information Society (NACIS),\xa0he is an award-winning interaction\xa0designer\xa0and cartographer working at the intersection of technology, creative\xa0arts, and academic scholarship in the humanities, social, and\xa0environmental sciences.

DHAsia Presents | Moveable Feasts: Street Food in the 21st Century City, by Anna Greenspan Shanghai’s emergence as a future metropolis threatens a vital aspect of its culinary culture. The snacks ( xiao chi 小吃) that are sold from the small shops and mobile stands of the city’s streets and alleyways - dumplings steamed in wooden baskets, nighttime barbeques, carts selling stir-fried noodles - are all disappearing. Shanghai’s officials and urban planners seem to subscribe to the dominant modernist narrative, which contends that development demands that the informality of street vending be replaced by the regulated order of chain stores and shopping malls. In Shanghai progress is often equated with ‘cleaning up the streets’. This talk aims to challenges this view, arguing that street food, street markets, street culture and street life are an integral part of the liveliness and livability of the 21st century city. It does so by presenting an ongoing project in the digital humanities that uses deep mapping and digital storytelling to investigate Shanghai’s shifting street food landscape and transforming culinary neighborhoods. During her residency at Stanford, Professor Greenspan\xa0will also lead a registration-required, hands-on DHAsia workshop. The registration link can be found here .

Their work uses spatial data to examine two empirical puzzles - China’s unexpected transition from a country without commercial banks to the world’s largest banking market in only three decades, and the large urban-rural gap in household sanitation across India. In this talk, Adam Liu will use spatial data of Chinese banks to examine the firm-level consequences of banking market competition in an authoritarian state. Anna Lunn geocodes national household survey data in order to characterize rural households’ personal connections to major cities. Incorporating a spatial approach to social ties allows her to examine how kinship geographies shape households’ investments in local public health. Adam Y. Liu is a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science, Stanford University and a current Digital Humanities-Asia Fellow. His research centers on how politics and political institutions affect economic outcomes. Along with his dissertation, his projects address the following questions: How does politics shape market structures? Why do contract-intensive markets develop without strong political institutions? Do political relations between nations still affect their economic ties in a globalized world? If so, when and how? Addressing these questions, he uses mixed methods, drawing extensively from fieldwork, archival materials, geospatial data, as well as experimental data. His primary geographical area of interest is China. Anna Lunn is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Sociology, Stanford University and a current Digital Humanities-Asia Fellow. Anna examines the intersection of development goals and private lives to understand how health and development emerge on the ground. Her dissertation applies this theoretical approach to understanding a significant global health challenge - household sanitation in rural India. Her research asks how social influence varies across social relationships and impacts personal health-related decisions? Specifically, how do the qualities and content of social ties shape individuals\' health investments and decisions? She combines multiple methodologies, including interviews, geocoding, and statistical analysis, to investigate these questions.', ""The 2024 Stanford Caribbean Studies Symposium with Professor Usha Iyer | Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis The 2024 Stanford Caribbean Studies Symposium features a talk by Stanford faculty member, Professor\xa0Usha\xa0Iyer\xa0(Film and Media Studies) who will present from their book project,\xa0Jammin’: Black and Brown Media\xa0Intimacies between India and the Caribbean.

Zoom information available for RSVPs. Food and wine will be provided to the in person attendees. About the Speaker Usha Iyer is an Assistant Professor in the Art and Art History Department at Stanford University. Their research and teaching interests lie at the intersection of cinema, performance, and gender and sexuality studies, with a specific focus on Global South cultural traffic along the vectors of race, gender, caste, and religion. Iyer\xa0(she/they)\xa0is the author of Dancing Women: Choreographing Corporeal Histories of Hindi Cinema (Oxford University Press, 2020), which\xa0examines constructions of gender, stardom, sexuality, and spectacle in Hindi cinema through women’s labor, collaborative networks, and gestural genealogies to produce a corporeal history of South Asian cultural modernities. Iyer’s current book project, Jammin’: Black and Brown Media Intimacies between India and the Caribbean (under contract with Columbia University Press),\xa0studies the deep affective engagement of Caribbean spectators with Indian cinema in relation to discourses of belonging and citizenship that have developed around the histories of African enslavement and Indian indentureship in Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, and Guyana. The book equally attends to the impact of Caribbean cultural forms on Indian film industries, which, through pirate and informal networks appropriated and adapted soca, chutney, and other musical and performance forms that were products of a creole modernity. \xa0Iyer is co-editing with Manishita Dass the volume, Shift Focus: Reframing the Indian New Waves (under contract with Oxford University Press). This anthology\xa0brings together a diverse group of scholars\xa0to examine the unexplored cultural, political, and aesthetic genealogies, impulses, and resonances of the Indian New Waves.

Contemporary ideas such as “political justice,” or “human rights,” not only appeared in the conceptual framework of eighteenth-century political, social, or philosophical theory, but the terms themselves also became part of the cultural lexicon. These compound concepts, in which two pre-existing terms are brought together into a new configuration with a single, stable meaning, form a critical backbone of eighteenth-century thought.

These compound concepts, in which two pre-existing terms are brought together into a new configuration with a single, stable meaning, form a critical backbone of eighteenth-century thought. In this project, I have trained a set of aligned vector models to trace the ways in which these kinds of concepts emerged within the eighteenth century. Using a new visualization that shows the changing relationships between the constituent parts of complex concepts over time, I focus the lens of this new tool on the concept of political revolution. With this method, I explore how the various changes in the discourse of revolution over the course of the eighteenth century set the stage for the political upheavals of the American and French Revolutions at the century’s close.

His forthcoming book, The Afterlife of the Sublime , explores the history of the sublime by tracing its discursive patterns through over 11,000 texts from the long eighteenth century, seeking clues to the disappearance of the term at the end of the Romantic period. As a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at McGill University, working with the Interacting with Print Research group, Dr. Algee-Hewitt was also involved in a variety of projects that combine literary interpretation with quantitative analysis. He is a co-coordinator of the Book History BiblioGraph, a new dynamic online resource and recommendation engine that visualizes connections between contemporary resources on Book History using statistical methods.']"

Rebecca Wall will join us to present: ""Slave Liberations in French West Africa, 1850-1905: A (Very) Preliminary Digital Model"" The end of slavery in French West Africa was a multi-decade process in which enslaved people played an active role in their own liberation. Between roughly 1850 and 1905, thousands of men, women, and children obtained freedom. Many approached French colonial officials to codify their legal status, adding their name, age, gender, time and place of birth, and date and location of liberation to governmental records. This paper discusses an ongoing project that takes a digital approach to working with these sources, now part of the collection of the Archives Nationales du Sénégal . We take demographic data from these liberation records, and ultimately, we plan to construct a visualization of slave liberations, as well as build a database over nearly 30,000 entries. In so doing, we propose a methodology that foregrounds the experiences of enslaved individuals and demonstrates how colonial archival sources keen insight into their experiences and actions. Rebecca Wall is a Ph.D Candidate in History at Stanford University and a 2019-2020 Geballe Dissertation Prize Fellow at the Stanford Humanities Center. She was a 2018-2019 Digital Humanities Graduate Research Fellow at CESTA. Rebecca studies how West African nations grapple with the fact that key environmental resources, like water, often traverse political frontiers, focusing on the case of the Senegal River basin. She is also interested in interdisciplinary research and has worked with colleagues in public health, engineering, hydrology, environmental planning, and economics.', 'CESTA Seminar | Gisch & Parker ""Museums, Media, and Memory in South Africa"" | Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis Over the past 200 years an enormous wealth and variety of museums has developed in South Africa.

The labor of these Chinese workers (who eventually numbered between 10-12,000 at any one moment) was central to creating the wealth that Leland Stanford used to found Stanford University. But these workers have never received the attention they deserve. We know relatively little about their lives. What led them to come to the United States? What experiences did they have in their arduous work? How did they live their daily lives? What kinds of communities did they create? How did their work on the railroad change the lives of their families in China and how did it change the lives of the workers themselves? The Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project seeks to give a voice to the Chinese migrants whose labor on the Transcontinental Railroad helped to shape the physical and social landscape of the American West. To this end, the project has developed a wide array of digital research methods and infrastructure—including archives, interactive maps, oral histories, and materials for teachers—and combined them with historical analysis to create a novel resource for those wishing to understand the history of the Chinese railroad workers. In this talk, the first in the CESTA Digital Humanities Public Lecture Series, Stanford Professor of History Gordon Chang and Dr. Roland Hsu , Director of Research of the project, will discuss the history of the Chinese railroad workers and describe the key findings and stories unearthed by this influential digital humanities project.', ""CANCELED - Shelley Fisher Fishkin and the Chinese Railroad Workers Project --Listening to Silence, Seeing Absence: The Challenge of Reconstructing Chinese Railroad Workers' Lives | Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis Between 1865 and 1869, thousands of Chinese migrants toiled at a grueling pace and in perilous working conditions to help construct the first transcontinental railroad across North America.
