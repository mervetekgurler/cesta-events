In their quantitative emphasis, based for example on shipping records, many such studies have diverged from more humanistic approaches, for which the focus has sometimes been on individuals whose lives are reconstructed in micro-narratives. While the scholarly value of big data in studying enslavement is beyond dispute, new projects come at a troubling moment in US history: for many North Americans, the legacies of enslavement are very much to the fore amidst heightened racial tensions and deepening economic inequalities. If, in such an environment, the term @nomorenames is politically significant, what implications might there be for scholarship? What are the trans-American perspectives and histories on the ""Data of Enslavement""? Is it possible that scholars with their data practices—even unconsciously and unwillingly—are adding new epistemological violence to the physical violence of the past? Join us on April 25th at 3 pm, for the ""Data of Enslavement"", the 7th session of our year-long Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series. We will hear from Lauren Klein, Alex Borucki, and Greg O'Malley about how they bring in humanistic approaches to large historical datasets in this sensitive theme and how they use these historical data to understand injustices in our contemporary world. If you cannot attend in person, you can request Zoom information via this link . Before the seminar, there will be a reception with appetizers starting at 2:30 pm. About the Speakers Alex Borucki is professor of history at the University of California, Irvine. He is the author of From Shipmates to Soldiers: Emerging Black Identities in the Río de la Plata (2015), co-editor of From the Galleon to the Highlands: Slave Trade Routes in the Spanish Americas (2020), and co-editor of The Rio de la Plata from Colony to Nations : Commerce, Society, and Politics (2021). Apart from other Spanish-language books and articles, he has published on the slave trade and the African Diaspora in the American Historical Review, Hispanic American Historical Review, William and Mary Quarterly, Colonial Latin American Review, The Americas, History in Africa, Itinerario, Atlantic Studies , and Slavery and Abolition . He is currently writing a book, co-authored with José Luis Belmonte Postigo, provisionally entitled “The Slave Trade and Silver in the Refinancing of the Spanish Empire during the Age of Revolutions.” By focusing on coastal merchant elites living in the Americas, this book examines how the availability of silver exports in several regions defined the timing, direction, and size of the slave trade in the Spanish Americas during the Age of Revolutions, when the traffic of captives gained prominence within the overall commerce and the financing of the colonial regime from Cuba to Buenos Aires.  Lauren Klein is Winship Distinguished Research Professor and Associate Professor in the departments of Quantitative Theory & Methods and English at Emory University. At Emory, she also serves as director of the Digital Humanities Lab and PI of the Mellon-funded Atlanta Interdisciplinary AI Network . Previously, she taught in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at Georgia Tech. Klein’s research brings together computational and critical methods in order to explore questions of gender, race, and justice, both in the past and in the present. She is the author of An Archive of Taste: Race and Eating in the Early United States (University of Minnesota Press, 2020) and, with Catherine D’Ignazio, the award-winning Data Feminism (MIT Press, 2020). With Matthew K. Gold, she edits Debates in the Digital Humanities , a hybrid print-digital publication stream that explores debates in the field as they emerge. Her work has appeared in leading humanities journals including PMLA, American Literature, and American Quarterly ; and at technical conferences including ACL , EMNLP , and IEEE VIS . Her research has been supported by grants and fellowships from the ACLS, the NEH, and the Mellon Foundation. Her next major project, Data by Design: An Interactive History of Data Visualization , is forthcoming from the MIT Press in 2024.  Greg O’Malley is professor of history at the University of California, Santa Cruz. His first book, Final Passages: The Intercolonial Slave Trade of British America, 1619-1807 , received four awards: The America Historical Association’s Forkosch Prize for British history; the AHA’s Rawley Prize for Atlantic history; The Owsley Award from the Southern Historical Association; and the Goveia Prize from the Association of Caribbean Historians. The project examines a complex network for distributing enslaved Africans throughout North America and the Caribbean after their survival of the Atlantic crossing. O’Malley is also co-creator (with Alex Borucki) of the Intra-American Slave Trade Database, an online research tool that documents more than 35,000 slave trading voyages from one port in the Americas to another. His second book, The Escapes of David George: An Odyssey of Slavery and Freedom in the Revolutionary Era , is forthcoming with St. Martin’s Press. It offers a life history of a man born enslaved in colonial Virginia, whose attempts to escape bondage resulted in wide-ranging travels, captivities, and re-enslavements, illuminating both enslaved people’s resistance and the constraints on their lives. David George eventually achieved emancipation by fleeing the emerging United States and running to the British Army during the Revolutionary War.","Thu April 25th 2024, 3:00 - 4:30pm","Wallenberg Hall, Room 433A","Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series: Data of Enslavement (WORK_OF_ART); Lauren Klein (PERSON); Alex Borucki (PERSON); Gregory O'Malley (PERSON); Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis Enslavement (ORG); American (NORP); Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series: Data of Enslavement (WORK_OF_ART); Lauren Klein (PERSON); Alex Borucki (PERSON); Gregory O'Malley (PERSON); American (NORP); US (GPE); North Americans (NORP); trans-American (NORP); April 25th (DATE); 3 pm (TIME); the ""Data of Enslavement"" (WORK_OF_ART); 7th (ORDINAL); Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series (WORK_OF_ART); Lauren Klein (PERSON); Alex Borucki (PERSON); Greg O'Malley (PERSON); Zoom (PRODUCT); 2:30 pm (TIME); Alex Borucki (PERSON); the University of California, Irvine (ORG); From Shipmates to Soldiers: Emerging Black Identities in the Río de la Plata (WORK_OF_ART); 2015 (DATE); From the Galleon to the Highlands: Slave Trade Routes in the Spanish Americas (WORK_OF_ART); 2020 (DATE); The Rio de la Plata from Colony to Nations : Commerce, Society, and Politics (WORK_OF_ART); 2021 (DATE); Spanish (LANGUAGE); African (NORP); the American Historical Review (ORG); Hispanic American Historical Review, William and Mary Quarterly, Colonial Latin American Review (WORK_OF_ART); The Americas, History in Africa, Itinerario, Atlantic Studies (WORK_OF_ART); Slavery and Abolition (WORK_OF_ART); José Luis Belmonte Postigo (PERSON); The Slave Trade and Silver in the Refinancing of the Spanish Empire during the Age of Revolutions (WORK_OF_ART); Americas (LOC); Spanish (NORP); Americas (LOC); the Age of Revolutions (EVENT); Cuba (GPE); Buenos Aires (GPE); Lauren Klein (PERSON); Winship (PERSON); Quantitative Theory & Methods (ORG); English (LANGUAGE); Emory University (ORG); Emory (ORG); the Digital Humanities Lab (ORG); Mellon (ORG); Atlanta Interdisciplinary AI Network (ORG); the School of Literature, Media (ORG); Georgia Tech (ORG); Klein’s (PERSON); An Archive of Taste: Race and Eating in the Early United States (WORK_OF_ART); University of Minnesota Press (ORG); 2020 (DATE); Catherine D’Ignazio (PERSON); Data Feminism (WORK_OF_ART); MIT Press (WORK_OF_ART); 2020 (DATE); Matthew K.

Contemporary ideas such as “political justice,” or “human rights,” not only appeared in the conceptual framework of eighteenth-century political, social, or philosophical theory, but the terms themselves also became part of the cultural lexicon. These compound concepts, in which two pre-existing terms are brought together into a new configuration with a single, stable meaning, form a critical backbone of eighteenth-century thought. In this project, I have trained a set of aligned vector models to trace the ways in which these kinds of concepts emerged within the eighteenth century. Using a new visualization that shows the changing relationships between the constituent parts of complex concepts over time, I focus the lens of this new tool on the concept of political revolution. With this method, I explore how the various changes in the discourse of revolution over the course of the eighteenth century set the stage for the political upheavals of the American and French Revolutions at the century’s close. About the Speaker: Mark Algee-Hewitt’s research focuses on the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in England and Germany and seeks to combine literary criticism with digital and quantitative analyses of literary texts. In particular he is interested in the history of aesthetic theory and the development and transmission of aesthetic and philosophic concepts during the Enlightenment and Romantic periods. He is also interested in the relationship between aesthetic theory and the poetry of the long eighteenth century.  Although his primary background is in English literature, he also has a degree in computer science. As the director of the Stanford Literary Lab, he is working to bring his interests in quantitative analysis, digital humanities and eighteenth-century literature to bear on a number of new collaborative projects. His forthcoming book, The Afterlife of the Sublime , explores the history of the sublime by tracing its discursive patterns through over 11,000 texts from the long eighteenth century, seeking clues to the disappearance of the term at the end of the Romantic period. As a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at McGill University, working with the Interacting with Print Research group, Dr. Algee-Hewitt was also involved in a variety of projects that combine literary interpretation with quantitative analysis. He is a co-coordinator of the Book History BiblioGraph, a new dynamic online resource and recommendation engine that visualizes connections between contemporary resources on Book History using statistical methods.","Tue April 19th 2022, 12:00 - 1:15pm",Hybrid event: in-person at CESTA and via Zoom.,"Mark Algee-Hewitt (PERSON); the Eighteenth Century (DATE); The eighteenth century (DATE); today (DATE); eighteenth-century (DATE); two (CARDINAL); eighteenth-century (DATE); Mark Algee-Hewitt (PERSON); Re-Formations: Visualizing Complex Concept Spaces in the Eighteenth Century"" (WORK_OF_ART); The eighteenth century (DATE); today (DATE); eighteenth-century (DATE); two (CARDINAL); eighteenth-century (DATE); the eighteenth century (DATE); the eighteenth century (DATE); American (NORP); French (NORP); Mark Algee-Hewitt’s (PERSON); the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries (DATE); England (GPE); Germany (GPE); the long eighteenth century (DATE); English (LANGUAGE); the Stanford Literary Lab (ORG); eighteenth-century (DATE); The Afterlife of the Sublime (WORK_OF_ART); 11,000 (CARDINAL); the long eighteenth century (DATE); Mellon (ORG); McGill University (ORG); the Interacting with Print Research (ORG); Algee-Hewitt (PERSON); the Book History BiblioGraph (ORG); Book History (WORK_OF_ART)","Mark Algee-Hewitt, Mark Algee-Hewitt, Mark Algee-Hewitt’s, Algee-Hewitt",Mark Algee-Hewitt

We are looking forward to welcoming you back into our space! A box lunch will be available to in-person attendees for takeaway. Zoom attendees can register using the link above. About this talk: How can we reveal systemic racism through data? The goal of the Stanford Libraries’ Know Systemic Racism project is to present factual data about interconnected systems that have been shaped by racist policies and practices of institutions across decades, with a focus on systems that threaten and perpetuate violence against people of African descent in California. One of the greatest challenges to making systemic racism visible through data is that archival records and data are structured, preserved, and presented according to systems that reflect institutional information management perpetuating white supremacy. The Know Systemic Racism data team is pursuing three approaches to help liberate data by using a knowledge graph to connect people, policing, legislation, housing discrimination, neighborhood conditions, and segregation to track racist policies and practices in California from the founding of the state in 1850 through to the present day. •    Identifying racist language within bills, legislation, and policies to make those datasets searchable •    Enriching knowledge bases, like Wikidata, with data about the lives lost in police encounters in California, and visualizing that data to make it accessible •    Building integrated map visualizations as means of browsing existing but siloed datasets The data and medata resulting from this work will be linked in a graph database to show the invisible connections between de jure segregation (local laws that mandated segregation) and de facto segregation (segregation that existed because of covert discrimination). About the speakers: Felicia A. Smith , MLIS, is the Inaugural Racial Justice and Social Equity Librarian at Stanford Libraries. Felicia’s primary focus is on launching Stanford Libraries’ Systemic Racism Tracker (SRT). She is responsible for outreach to faculty and students interested in issues of race, ethnicity, and social equity across all departments, schools as well as the Equity, Community, Leadership (ECL) centers. Felicia believes that as an African American librarian, she is charged with the awesome responsibility of being a keeper of the light and protector of our shared memories. Felicia believes that before we as a society can “Know Justice” we must interrogate the injustices and right the wrongs of society, and only then will we “Know Peace.” Nicole Coleman is Digital Research Architect for the Stanford University Libraries and Research Director for Humanities+Design, a research lab at the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis. Nicole works at the intersection of the digital library and digital scholarship as a lead architect in the design and development of practical research services. She is currently leading an initiative within the Library to identify and enact applications of artificial intelligence —machine perception, machine learning, machine reasoning, and language recognition— to make the collections of maps, photographs, manuscripts, data sets and other assets more easily discoverable, accessible, and analyzable. Gabriela Basel is a PhD student in the Chemical Engineering department at Stanford University. She is in the middle of a year off from her PhD, working as an intern on the Stanford Libraries’ Know Systemic Racism project and assisting in Santa Clara County-level initiatives to improve county accountability of Stanford University and establish community-based public safety initiatives at Stanford and the county. She hopes to bring what she learns from these experiences to her chemical engineering research to improve ethical community engagement within engineering infrastructure initiatives. Mahogany Brown is an undergraduate student in Economics at Stanford and Vice President of Communications for the FLIPOC Resources and Workforce Development (FRWD) Collective at Stanford. As an intern at Stanford Libraries working on the Know Systemic Racism, Mahogany has been analyzing California state laws and proposed legislation to prepare a dataset for the Jim Crow California: Anti-Black Laws Matter project. Akosua Kissi is a 3rd year undergraduate student in the Political Science and Psychology departments at Stanford University. She is interested in understanding how anti-Black racism structurally affects U.S institutions resulting in her internship at the Stanford Libraries’ Know Systemic Racism project. Akosua also holds leadership positions in Stanford Women in Business and the FLIPOC Resources and Workforce Development (FRWD) Collective to help students of color get access to professional opportunities within the undergraduate community. Favour Nerrise is an electrical engineering Ph.D. student at Stanford University, currently researching tools, models and methodologies that can help medical professionals better understand how the brain functions. She also has risen from NSBE local chapter president to her current role as National Chairperson as she leads its effort to increase diversity in the engineering field.

The immediate goal is the online publication of selected legal trial documents from Dutch colonial archives, but the larger aim is to create a portal to facilitate engagement with a neglected aspect of South African and slave histories. Several questions arise and deserve wide-ranging discussion, including the relative advantages of big data as opposed to more traditional approaches; the ethics of engaging with pasts that some would prefer to forget. How to negotiate between different potential audiences, whether school learners, descendants, scholars or tourists? What concept of narrative is most productive in making sense of these court trials, and what are the implications for their digitization?

Race, Technology, and the Political Problem of Personhood""","Join us for the first Digital Horizons Lecture, a new series presented in partnership with the Stanford Humanities Center (SHC). In this lecture, Sylvester A. Johnson interprets the work of Ibn Rushd (""Averroës""), the twelfth-century Islamic scholar of Andalusia who achieved renown as the ‘father’ of secularism, in order to elucidate and heuristically challenge Ibn Rushd’s theory of the intellect as a power of the soul. Johnson leverages Rushd’s distinction between sensing and knowing in order to examine contemporary, sensory-driven AI technology (particularly brain-computer-interface architectures) as a uniquely generative problem of interest for humanists and technical experts alike. Of central importance is the sensation of pain, as it constitutes a phenomenon of embodiment, a category of human experience, and a political problem that has been implicated in histories of racial domination. About the speaker: Sylvester A. Johnson is Assistant Vice Provost for the Humanities and Executive Director of the “Tech for Humanity” initiative at Virginia Tech. He is the founding director of Virginia Tech’s new Center for Humanities, which is supporting human-centered research and humanistic approaches to the guidance of technology. Sylvester’s research has examined religion, race, and empire in the Atlantic world; religion and sexuality; national security practices; and the impact of intelligent machines and human enhancement on human identity and race governance. In addition to co-facilitating a national working group on religion and U.S. empire, Johnson led an Artificial Intelligence project that developed a successful proof-of-concept machine learning application to ingest and analyze a humanities text. He is the author of The Myth of Ham in Nineteenth-Century American Christianity (Palgrave 2004), a study of race and religious hatred that won the American Academy of Religion’s Best First Book award; and African American Religions, 1500-2000 (Cambridge 2015), an award-winning interpretation of five centuries of democracy, c olonialism, and freedom in the Atlantic world. Johnson has also co-edited The FBI and Religion: Faith and National Security Before and After 9/11 (University of California 2017). He is a founding co-editor of the Journal of Africana Religions. He is currently producing a digital scholarly edition of an early English history of global religions and writing a book on human identity in an age of intelligent machines and human-machine symbiosis.

1716323825-105.html,Centering People in Information Translation | Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis, ,Centering People in Information Translation," About this talk: Inaccessible information has wide-ranging consequences. These span people with disabilities being unable to read COVID-19 infographics to them being excluded from digital networks like social media and remote meetings which frequently and rapidly transmit highly visual information. One approach to increasing nonvisual access to information for people who are blind and low vision is artificial intelligence (AI), which promises automation and scalability. However, research and media reports continue to illuminate AI-bias and malicious applications. As these harms tend to impact people who already experience marginalization, the ethics of applying AI to solve perennial accessibility challenges is complicated. In this talk I will overview one project I led concerning one facet of information accessibility—how people are represented in human and AI-generated alternative (alt) text descriptions. I will share findings from interviews I conducted with blind people who rely on alt text to understand visual information and who also identified as a minoritized race or gender shown to be disproportionately misrepresented by AI-powered human recognition systems. From their experiences and perspectives, I synthesized alt text design considerations. However, I will conclude the talk with provocations for the audience, rooted in examples from art and disability activism, which ask us to move beyond future systems which invisibly automate alt text production to reveal and reimagine human-centered methods for interpreting visual content into nonvisual formats. About the speaker: Cynthia Bennett is a Postdoctoral Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute.

We are looking forward to welcoming you back into our space! A box lunch will be available to in-person attendees for takeaway. Zoom attendees can register using the link above. About this talk : The rise of “born digital” maps requires a rethinking of how we draw borders. Digital maps are algorithmic: the smooth lines of borders result from mathematical rules. While border lines on maps were once freehand patterns in graphite or ink, borders created by software assume exact spatial coordinates connected by formulas. But whose data and which formulas? Over the past few decades, researchers have created a rich vocabulary for discussing frontiers, contact zones, and other shared and contested spaces, but our cartographic vocabulary still favors simple linear borders. Born digital maps thus invite a combination of data science and critical theory, exploring the power relations and assumptions behind seemingly objective mundane or practices. This paper explore these questions in terms of early modern Japan: how can we draw maps that depict confusion, ambiguity, or contestation? About the speaker : Mark Ravina is Professor of History at the University of Texas at Austin. His specialty is Japanese history, especially the transnational and international dimension of state-building. His third book, To Stand with the Nations of the World: Japan’s Meiji Restoration as World History was published in 2017 by Oxford University Press and won the best book prize of the Southeast Conference of the Association for Asian Studies. He is currently working on two digital humanities projects. The first employs text mining to explore changes in Japanese political vocabulary in the 1870s and 1880s. The second focuses on the challenge of mapping changing political and administrative borders in nineteenth-century Japan.","Tue March 15th 2022, 12:00 - 1:15pm",HYBRID EVENT: IN-PERSON AT CESTA AND VIA ZOOM,"Mark Ravina (PERSON); Rethinking Borders in a Digital Age"" (WORK_OF_ART); Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis Note (WORK_OF_ART); Mark Ravina (PERSON); Rethinking Borders in a Digital Age"" Note (WORK_OF_ART); the past few decades (DATE); Japan (GPE); Mark Ravina (PERSON); the University of Texas (ORG); Austin (GPE); Japanese (NORP); third (ORDINAL); To Stand with the Nations of the World: Japan’s Meiji Restoration as World History (WORK_OF_ART); 2017 (DATE); Oxford University Press (ORG); the Southeast Conference (EVENT); the Association for Asian Studies (ORG); two (CARDINAL); first (ORDINAL); Japanese (NORP); 1870s (DATE); 1880s (DATE); second (ORDINAL); nineteenth-century (DATE); Japan (GPE)","Mark Ravina, Mark Ravina, Mark Ravina",Mark Ravina

About this talk: This seminar will introduce participants to a new digital project on two major manuscripts surviving from the earlier thirteenth century that attest to the commemoration of senior female religious figures. We have created an interactive map that displays historical and geographical data, coupled with palaeographical and contextual investigation, of some four hundred religious houses. From this have emerged extensive networks of religious association that are beginning to yield rich results, encouraging an essential reappraisal of the development of writing from 1200-1250 and a reassessment of our understanding of literacy and memorialization in this period. About the speakers: Elaine Treharne, the Roberta Bowman Denning Professor in the Stanford Department of English, is a Welsh medievalist with specializations in manuscript studies, archives, information technologies, and early British literature. Recent publications include Perceptions of Medieval Manuscripts: The Phenomenal Book (Oxford University Press, 2021) and, with Claude Willan, Text Technologies: A History (Stanford University Press, 2019). Her newest work concerns the application of machine learning and AI to investigate medieval manuscripts and the transmission of textual culture. Two new book projects are underway: an Introduction to Manuscript Studies and a new collaboration with Greg Walker, Landscapes of Immortality , which investigates sacred sites, memorialisation, and the human desire to be remembered. Mateusz Fafinski is a historian and digital humanist, currently a postdoc at University of Lausanne, and an Assistant Lecturer at Freie Universität Berlin. Previously, he was a TextTechnologies Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University. Mateusz  works on the nature of historical sources in the digital sphere, mapping medieval Latin manuscripts, and the role of urban space in Early Medieval societies as well as the inheritance of Rome in the post-Roman world.

We are looking forward to welcoming you back into our space! A box lunch will be available to in-person attendees for takeaway. About this talk : This talk examines the use of computer simulations—particularly agent-based modeling (ABM)—as part of the digital humanists’ toolkit. ABM is a technique to simulate the behavior of individual agents, measuring the consequences of the interactions of these agents within a modeled environment. In this particular case study, the method served to replicate virtually the spatial dynamic of the expanding agricultural frontier in early Brazil. As argued by extensive literature, colonists’ adoption of slash-and-burn farming methods increased the pressure over the Atlantic rainforest, leading to deforestation. The agent-based model created for this study thus permits assessing the scale of this process in a situation in which primary evidence is scarce and mostly anecdotal. The presentation of the simulation and some results foregrounds a broader discussion of some potentials and limitations of ABM among digital humanities practitioners. About the speaker : Leonardo Barleta is a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford Data Science. He is a historian of Latin America, whose research interests focus mostly on the historical production of space, including topics ranging from territorial formation and geographic mobility to land tenure and environmental change to urbanization—all of which prominently feature digital methods.

From Oral Horton To Written Horton, and Now Digital Horton. Using the tools of digital technology, we are able to transport the reader (viewer) back to the Antebellum Chapel Hill, 1830s. In the early 1990s, game computer designers introduced a new concept into the game industry called the avatar. By using a computer game the player began “to experience” his playing of a game through the avatar. This concept of “experiencing” something—of having an “experience”—is entirely new in fiction narration. The narration had been limited to books, to reading.  Here was a new way to “experience” a narrative—without reading. Like Torben Groda, Professor of media art at the University of Copenhagen, we will present Horton's poetry as a game that is like a “real-life experience”. I ask, how might it be possible to use virtual reality to do just that—to “experience” Horton’s world as an ‘embodied’ experience”? In our demonstration, we create an Acoustic Avatar of George Moses Horton to show how the user can “experience” Horton’s poetry. In collaboration with Tylar Campbell, a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT) from Simon Fraser University, and Professor Steve DiPaola at the SIAT iVizLab, who is a highly regarded scholar] and innovator with AI including GPT 3, computational systems for expression, movement, and gestures, we were able to create a virtual world for Horton and occupy this immersive experience. With Tylar as the role player in the game, we decided to allow the avatar/Horton to interact with other characters. In addition, we allowed Tylar to “improvise” with the essential story of the real Horton, along with real incidents. In other words, we learned to fictionalize the story through the avatar/character. We focused on analyzing the activities of a player through three angles: character creation, character interaction, and game mechanics. About the speakers: Cecil Brown is the author of four novels (beginning with The Life and Loves of Mr. Jiveass Nigger in 1969), a memoir, the screenplay for Richard Pryor’s Which Way is Up?, and numerous essays in journals and newspapers over the last 50 years. After earning degrees at Columbia University, the University of Chicago, and U.C. Berkeley, Mr. Brown has taught at colleges and universities in France and Germany as well as at U.C. Davis, U.C. Berkeley, and four other colleges in the Bay Area.  He is currently affiliated with Stanford University as a researcher at their Spatial History Project and has a work in progress on James Baldwin. Mr. Brown resides in Berkeley, CA. Tylar Campbell is a PhD student specializing in Critical Computation Media at Simon Fraser University’s School of Interactive Arts & Technology (SIAT). He is a data-journalist with a MA from Stanford University. As a member of the Making Culture Lab at SIAT, his research explores fugitive anthropology, multi-modal scholarship, and the role of digital technology to create new realities and re-cognize past, present, and futures. His MA thesis consisted of an oral history of lynching in the American Deep South, that traces his ancestral lineage as a direct descendant of Wesley Johnson, victim of the last mob lynching in Alabama. This led to a multi-modal production of storytelling with a data visual, written narrative and podcast. His video and multimedia work investigate preservation methodologies to address fugitive histories and how these spaces are being reclaimed. His current project includes art-based research-creation, community-based co-production, and immersive media.","Tue February 1st 2022, 12:00 - 1:15pm",Online via Zoom,Cecil Brown (PERSON); Tylar Campbell (PERSON); Liberty: Revival of African American Folk Culture in the Age of Digital Technology (WORK_OF_ART); George Moses Horton (PERSON); Oral Horton (PERSON); Horton (PERSON); Now Digital Horton (WORK_OF_ART); Antebellum Chapel Hill (FAC); 1830s (DATE); the early 1990s (DATE); Cecil Brown (PERSON); Tylar Campbell (PERSON); Liberty: Revival of African American Folk Culture in the Age of Digital Technology (WORK_OF_ART); George Moses Horton (PERSON); Oral Horton (PERSON); Horton (PERSON); Now Digital Horton (WORK_OF_ART); Antebellum Chapel Hill (FAC); 1830s (DATE); the early 1990s (DATE); Torben Groda (PERSON); the University of Copenhagen (ORG); Horton's (PERSON); Horton’s (PERSON); George Moses Horton (PERSON); Horton’s (WORK_OF_ART); Tylar Campbell (PERSON); Ph.D. (WORK_OF_ART); the School of Interactive Arts and Technology (ORG); SIAT (ORG); Simon Fraser University (ORG); Steve DiPaola (PERSON); the SIAT iVizLab (ORG); 3 (CARDINAL); Horton (PERSON); Tylar (PERSON); Horton (PERSON); Tylar (PERSON); Horton (PERSON); three (CARDINAL); Cecil Brown (PERSON); four (CARDINAL); The Life and Loves of Mr. Jiveass Nigger (WORK_OF_ART); 1969 (DATE); Richard Pryor’s Which Way is Up?

After Mikhail Bakhitn’s pioneering ideas of dialogism and polyphony of Fyodor Dostoevsky’s novels it became especially common to view the novel as a balanced dramatization of conflicts among polar opposites. In my ongoing research project on the network analysis of Russian realist and modernist novels, I approach the character networks as models of an emerging liberal society which, on the one hand, captured the socio-political trends of the time and, on the other, provided Russian society with ideas on how to shape a horizontal, heterarchical structure of social structure. The different network shapes of the Russian novels from realism to modernism  correspond to the underlying aesthetic and social changes of the Russian society before and after the revolution of 1917.  About this speaker: Yuliya Ilchuk’s research interests fall under the broad heading of cultural exchange, interaction, and borrowing between Russia and Ukraine. Her first book, Nikolai Gogol: Performing Hybrid Identity (University of Toronto Press, 2021), revises Gogol’s identity and texts as ambivalent and hybrid by situating them in the in-between space of Russian and Ukrainian cultures. In her ongoing research projects and teaching, she integrates traditional humanistic approaches to the text with computer assisted methods. Some of her recent projects include distant network analysis of the Russian realist novels as models of the emerging liberal society; geo-spatial analysis of the post-Soviet transformation of the city as a rhizome with multiple, non-hierarchical relationship between the old and new urban cultures; a study of Ukrainian atomopolises as spaces for the intensive implementation of lost utopian Socialist ideals; and a study of memory and space in protracted displacement in contemporary Ukrainian literature and film on/by refugees.","Tue January 18th 2022, 12:00 - 1:15pm",Online via Zoom,"Yuliya Ilchuk (PERSON); The Network Shape of the Russian Novel"" (WORK_OF_ART); Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (WORK_OF_ART); Russian (NORP); Russia’s (NORP); Mikhail Bakhitn’s (PERSON); Fyodor Dostoevsky’s (PERSON); Yuliya Ilchuk (PERSON); The Network Shape of the Russian Novel (WORK_OF_ART); Russian (NORP); Russia’s (NORP); Mikhail Bakhitn’s (PERSON); Fyodor Dostoevsky’s (PERSON); Russian (NORP); Russian (NORP); Russian (NORP); Russian (NORP); 1917 (DATE); Yuliya Ilchuk’s (PERSON); Russia (GPE); Ukraine (GPE); first (ORDINAL); Nikolai Gogol (PERSON); Performing Hybrid Identity (WORK_OF_ART); University of Toronto Press (ORG); 2021 (DATE); Gogol’s (WORK_OF_ART); Russian (NORP); Ukrainian (NORP); Russian (NORP); Soviet (NORP); Ukrainian (NORP); Socialist (NORP); Ukrainian (NORP)","Yuliya Ilchuk, Mikhail Bakhitn’s, Fyodor Dostoevsky’s, Yuliya Ilchuk, Mikhail Bakhitn’s, Fyodor Dostoevsky’s, Yuliya Ilchuk’s, Nikolai Gogol","Yuliya Ilchuk, Mikhail Bakhitn, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Nikolai Gogol"

We study how high streets and other urban phenomena intersect with various elements and vectors of urban life such as restaurants, ethnic food stores, transport systems, parks, and the real estate market, among other phenomena, even when these do not appear to be obviously related to one another in the first instance. The project also has an interest in the apparent messiness of migration and settlement for understanding the different ways in which globalization has been sedimented in these cities in the 20th and 21st centuries. About the speaker: Ato Quayson is the Jean G. and Morris M. Doyle Professor in Interdisciplinary Studies and Professor of English at Stanford. He studied for his undergraduate degree at the University of Ghana and took his Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge, where he taught in the Faculty of English from 1995-2005.

By data visualization methods, the project moves from one period of precarity to another, documenting, in the years between, the remarkable growth of a tight-knit profession of bankers and bond attorneys. Ultimately, it helps users see that the bond market was made not through supply and demand or other autonomous forces, but by a relatively small group of identifiable people who bought, sold, held, and resold debt, and who helped turn cities into tax-exempt investment vehicles. Destin Jenkins is a scholar of racial inequality. His work bridges the fields of economic, urban, and political history, and focuses on capitalism, democracy, and social movements in the United States during the long twentieth century. He is the author of The Bonds of Inequality: Debt and the Making of the American City (University of Chicago Press, 2021) and the principal investigator and curator of The Business of Debt, a digital humanities project that reveals how the twentieth-century municipal bond market was not driven by abstract processes, but stitched together by a small, but powerful cadre of financiers and attorneys.

Not only are our new methods collaborative by nature, they are often collaborative by necessity, frequently requiring us to work in teams that can leverage different experience and skills towards a set of research goals. In this talk, I want to explore the ramifications of this shift in research practice, focusing on the sociology of the humanities lab, as distinct from both the science laboratory, and the traditional practices of History, Classics, Philosophy, Cultural Studies, and Literary Study. How has the collaborative nature of our work altered the kinds of research that we can produce? How has interdisciplinary cooperation challenged ideas of evidence, method and results in the humanities? How has the collaborative model of research changed our pedagogy? What new kinds of equality, and inequality, between faculty, staff and students, has this change enabled? And what does it mean to work collaborative in fields whose institutional structures persist in disincentivizing collaboration? Drawing on my own experience working at, and directing, the Stanford Literary Lab, an ongoing collaborative research group that is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, I want to focus on the outstanding questions that we are only now beginning to address around this radical shift in the humanities.

Dee II Graduate Fellow, will stop by the Lane Center to discuss his new book, Paper Trails: The US Post and the Making of the American West . Blevins will be joined in conversation by Richard White, co-founding director of the Bill Lane Center for the American West, and Charlotte Hull, current Thomas D. Dee II Graduate Fellow. About the Book: Paper Trails argues that the US Post wove together two of the era’s defining projects: western expansion and the growth of state power. Between the 1860s and the early 1900s, the western United States underwent a dramatic reorganization of people, land, capital, and resources. As millions of settlers moved into the region, they relied on letters and newspapers, magazines and pamphlets, petitions and money orders to stay connected to the wider world. Paper Trails maps the spread of the US Post using a dataset of more than 100,000 post offices, revealing a new picture of the federal government in the West. The western postal network bore little resemblance to the civil service bureaucracies typically associated with government institutions. Instead, the US Post grafted public mail service onto private businesses, contracting with stagecoach companies to carry the mail and paying local merchants to distribute letters from their stores. These arrangements allowed the US Post to operate what Blevins has termed a “gossamer network,” rapidly spinning out a vast and ephemeral web of postal infrastructure to thousands of distant places. The postal network’s sprawling geography and localized operations forces a reconsideration of the American state, its history, and the ways in which it exercised power.

This presentation proposes to address the topic of born-digital heritage and in particular of web archives in context. It aims to question the past, present and future paths of research based on the plethora of born-digital sources that developed from the mid-1990s. Analysis of web archives requires both taking into account the very shaping of these archives - e.g. web archiving in context - and placing research on these web archives in context, from the early studies of the 2000s which focused on the nature of web archives themselves and the methods for studying them to current research that takes them as sources for exploring digital cultures. Thus, the first two parts of our presentation, devoted respectively to the history of web archiving and of web archives in research, will explore the multiple contextual elements at work. These may be related to the Web itself and its evolution, to institutional policies, or to crawling and analysis tools, and understanding them is crucial for addressing the current and future challenges that will arise for researchers, whether they concern transnational approaches, ethical issues or a claim for enhanced contextualization. In conclusion we will broaden the question to digital humanities, and consider why web archive studies have remained relatively marginalised in digital humanities discourse.

That Islamic geographers were instrumental in the transmission of classical spatial knowledge, such as Ptolemy’s Optics, to the European Renaissance is well known. Subsequent knowledge production, however, remains overlooked. As a team, CISTERN has been working on a database and a virtual space that enable researchers to dive into the depths of this material, map its stratified flows of data, and explore the undercurrents of politics, economy, and culture from the perspective of objects such as atlases, compendiums, and maps. The searchable database incorporates existing bibliographical repositories, reframing them to respond to the needs of current users across fields and disciplines. This tool is housed in a virtual space that has the basic architecture of a cistern, a calm underground space sustaining a bustling city. It includes an exhibit hall and a reading room where the database can be searched and visualized. The pairing of the database with a virtual space is designed to generate new research questions in the history of the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe while offering an immersive environment to conduct research, engage with heritage, and focus one’s attention. Adrien Zakar, Merve Tekgürler, and Umar Patel will introduce the project for 40 minutes and then open the floor for questions and input.

In particular, we compare a set of transcribed contemporary psychotherapy sessions to other forms of discourse including 20th- and 21st-century novels and memoirs, podcast interviews, and informal recorded conversation. We are interested in what distinguishes psychotherapeutic discourse from other types of discourse and how analytical protocols from literary studies and digital humanities can be productively applied to psychotherapeutic discourse issuing from a clinical setting. How is language used differently across these types of discourse? How similar are therapeutic encounters portrayed in fictional texts to actual therapy sessions? Which parts of 20th- and 21st-century literature look the most like therapy sessions? We approach these questions using a variety of computational tools sets that allow us to model the language of the therapeutic encounter in literary spaces.

The lecture will be followed up by a panel by Professors Adrian Daub and Chiara Sabatti of Stanford University, and a reception at 6 pm. RSVP is necessary for entry. In Data Feminism (MIT Press, 2020), Klein and her coauthor Catherine D'Ignazio established a set of principles for doing more just and equitable data science. Informed by the past several decades of intersectional feminist activism and critical thought, the principles of data feminism modeled how to examine and challenge power, rethink binaries and hierarchies, elevate emotion and embodiment, consider context, embrace pluralism, and make labor visible. How can these principles be applied to the current conversation about AI, its present harms, and its future possibilities? This talk will briefly summarize the principles of data feminism before moving to a set of examples that show how these principles can be applied–and extended–in our current technological landscape. Please RSVP for this talk via this Eventbrite Link . This talk is jointly hosted by the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) , and Stanford Data Science , and co-sponsored by the Stanford University Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) , The Clayman Institute for Gender Research , and the Stanford Humanities Center . 4:00 PM - 4:30 PM -- Registration & networking 4:30 PM - 6:00 PM -- Data Feminism for AI Presentation, Panel, and Q&A 6:00 PM - 6:30 PM -- Networking reception About Lauren Klein Lauren Klein is Winship Distinguished Research Professor and Associate Professor in the departments of Quantitative Theory & Methods and English at Emory University. At Emory, she also serves as director of the Digital Humanities Lab and PI of the Mellon-funded Atlanta Interdisciplinary AI Network . Previously, she taught in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at Georgia Tech. Klein’s research brings together computational and critical methods in order to explore questions of gender, race, and justice, both in the past and in the present. She is the author of An Archive of Taste: Race and Eating in the Early United States (University of Minnesota Press, 2020) and, with Catherine D’Ignazio, the award-winning Data Feminism (MIT Press, 2020). With Matthew K. Gold, she edits Debates in the Digital Humanities , a hybrid print-digital publication stream that explores debates in the field as they emerge. Her work has appeared in leading humanities journals including PMLA, American Literature, and American Quarterly; and at technical conferences including ACL, EMNLP, and IEEE VIS. Her research has been supported by grants and fellowships from the ACLS, the NEH, and the Mellon Foundation. Her next major project, Data by Design: An Interactive History of Data Visualization , is forthcoming from the MIT Press in 2024. About Adrian Daub Adrian Daub is the Barbara D. Finberg Director of the Clayman Institute, a position he began in 2019. He is the J. E. Wallace Sterling Professor of the Humanities and a professor of comparative literature and German studies in the School of Humanities and Sciences. Daub also has served as director of the Andrew W. Mellon Program for Postdoctoral Studies in the Humanities, director of undergraduate studies for the Division of Literatures, Cultures and Languages, director of German studies, and director of the Program in Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. Daub is the 11th director and the first man to lead the Clayman Institute for Gender Research. He writes about politics, literature, culture, and universities for German and Swiss newspapers and for Anglo-American outlets. Together with Laura Goode, he hosts the Clayman Institute’s podcast, The Feminist Present , which features interviews with a range of feminist voices. For the podcast In Bed With the Right, Moira Donegan and Daub welcome scholars and critics to analyze right wing ideas about gender, sex and sexuality – and to plumb the ways in which these ideas persist in and shape our present moment. Daub’s research focuses on the intersection of literature, music and philosophy, particularly in the 19th century. His book Uncivil Unions - The Metaphysics of Marriage in German Idealism and Romanticism explores German philosophical theories of marriage from Kant to Nietzsche. His book Tristan's Shadow - Sexuality and the Total Work of Art deals with eroticism in German opera after Wagner. Four-Handed Monsters ties the practice of four-hand piano playing to ideologies about gender, labor, and the family in nineteenth-century Europe. In addition, he has published articles on opera, film, and poetry, as well as literature and scandal. Daub began on the Stanford faculty in 2008, after earning a doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania. He also earned a master’s there in 2004, and a bachelor’s from Swarthmore College in 2003. For more detail about his work and publications, visit www.adriandaub.com . About Chiara Sabatti Chiara grew up in Italy. She got a BS+MS in ""Economics and Social Sciences"" (DES) from the Bocconi University in Milan, where, among other things, she was schooled in the beauty of Bayesian Statistics. After trying out the US graduate school system for a semester at Brandeis, she came to Stanford in 1994 to pursue a PhD in Statistics, and has been in California ever since. Her graduate work was with Jun Liu on multiscale MCMC methods. She then went on to be a post-doctoral scholar with Neil Risch in the Department of Genetics, also at Stanford. In 2000 she joined the faculty at UCLA in the newly established departments of Human Genetics and Statistics. After 9 happy years in sunny southern California, she came back north with her family. She is one of the founding members of the department of Biomedical Data Science and one of the associate directors of Stanford Data Science, as well as a professor of Statistics (her first love). Chiara's research is centered on the development of statistical methods that enable the exploration of high dimensional data. This entails both reducing computational barriers and ensuring that the results obtained by sifting through a large number of variables are reliable, reproducible, and robust. Her work is by nature interdisciplinary: she has enjoyed collaborating with neuroscientists, engineers, chemists, psychiatrists, oncologists, and more in her home institutions and around the globe. She is grateful that her background prepared her for this.","Wed April 24th 2024, 4:30 - 6:00pm","John A. and Cynthia Fry Gunn Rotunda, E241 at the ChEM-H / Neuro research complex","Data Feminism for AI"" (WORK_OF_ART); Lauren Klein (PERSON); Departments of English and Quantitative Theory and Methods (ORG); Emory University (ORG); Adrian Daub (PERSON); Chiara Sabatti (PERSON); Stanford University (ORG); 6 pm (TIME); RSVP (ORG); ""Data Feminism for AI"" (WORK_OF_ART); Lauren Klein (PERSON); Departments of English and Quantitative Theory and Methods (ORG); Emory University (ORG); Adrian Daub (PERSON); Chiara Sabatti (PERSON); Stanford University (ORG); 6 pm.

The lecture will be followed up by a panel by Professors Adrian Daub and Chiara Sabatti of Stanford University. The talk will be followed by a reception. RSVP is necessary for entry.  In Data Feminism (MIT Press, 2020), Klein and her coauthor Catherine D'Ignazio established a set of principles for doing more just and equitable data science. Informed by the past several decades of intersectional feminist activism and critical thought, the principles of data feminism modeled how to examine and challenge power, rethink binaries and hierarchies, elevate emotion and embodiment, consider context, embrace pluralism, and make labor visible. How can these principles be applied to the current conversation about AI, its present harms, and its future possibilities? This talk will briefly summarize the principles of data feminism before moving to a set of examples that show how these principles can be applied–and extended–in our current technological landscape. Please RSVP for this talk via this Eventbrite Link . This talk is jointly hosted by the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) , and Stanford Data Science , and co-sponsored by the Stanford University Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) , The Clayman Institute for Gender Research , and the Stanford Humanities Center . About Lauren Klein Lauren Klein is Winship Distinguished Research Professor and Associate Professor in the departments of Quantitative Theory & Methods and English at Emory University. At Emory, she also serves as director of the Digital Humanities Lab and PI of the Mellon-funded Atlanta Interdisciplinary AI Network . Previously, she taught in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at Georgia Tech. Klein’s research brings together computational and critical methods in order to explore questions of gender, race, and justice, both in the past and in the present. She is the author of An Archive of Taste: Race and Eating in the Early United States (University of Minnesota Press, 2020) and, with Catherine D’Ignazio, the award-winning Data Feminism (MIT Press, 2020). With Matthew K. Gold, she edits Debates in the Digital Humanities , a hybrid print-digital publication stream that explores debates in the field as they emerge. Her work has appeared in leading humanities journals including PMLA, American Literature, and American Quarterly; and at technical conferences including ACL, EMNLP, and IEEE VIS. Her research has been supported by grants and fellowships from the ACLS, the NEH, and the Mellon Foundation. Her next major project, Data by Design: An Interactive History of Data Visualization , is forthcoming from the MIT Press in 2024. About Adrian Daub Adrian Daub is the Barbara D. Finberg Director of the Clayman Institute, a position he began in 2019. He is the J. E.

About Chiara Sabatti Chiara is a professor of Biomedical Data Science and Statistics.She came to Stanford in 1994 to pursue a PhD in Statistics, and has been in California ever since. Her graduate work was with Jun Liu on multiscale MCMC methods. She then went on to be a post-doctoral scholar with Neil Risch in the Department of Genetics, also at Stanford. In 2000 she joined the faculty at UCLA in the newly established departments of Human Genetics and Statistics. After 9 happy years, she came back to Stanford. She is one of the founding members of the department of Biomedical Data Science and one of the associate directors of Stanford Data Science, as well as a professor of Statistics. Chiara's research is centered on the development of statistical methods that enable the exploration of high dimensional data. This entails both reducing computational barriers and ensuring that the results obtained by sifting through a large number of variables are reliable, reproducible, and robust.","Wed April 24th 2024, 4:00 - 6:30pm","Stanford Neurosciences Building 290 Jane Stanford Way, Stanford, CA 94305 E241","Data Feminism for AI"" (WORK_OF_ART); Lauren Klein (PERSON); Departments of English and Quantitative Theory and Methods (ORG); Emory University (ORG); Adrian Daub (PERSON); Chiara Sabatti (PERSON); Stanford University (ORG); RSVP (ORG); ""Data Feminism for AI"" (WORK_OF_ART); Lauren Klein (PERSON); Departments of English and Quantitative Theory and Methods (ORG); Emory University (ORG); Adrian Daub (PERSON); Chiara Sabatti (PERSON); Stanford University (ORG); RSVP (ORG); Data Feminism (ORG); MIT Press (ORG); 2020 (DATE); Klein (PERSON); Catherine D'Ignazio (PERSON); the past several decades (DATE); Eventbrite Link (ORG); the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (ORG); CESTA (ORG); Stanford Data Science (ORG); Stanford University Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (ORG); HAI (ORG); The Clayman Institute for Gender Research (ORG); the Stanford Humanities Center (ORG); Lauren Klein (PERSON); Lauren Klein (PERSON); Winship (PERSON); Quantitative Theory & Methods (ORG); English (LANGUAGE); Emory University (ORG); Emory (ORG); the Digital Humanities Lab (ORG); Mellon (ORG); Atlanta Interdisciplinary AI Network (ORG); the School of Literature, Media (ORG); Georgia Tech (ORG); Klein’s (PERSON); An Archive of Taste: Race and Eating in the Early United States (WORK_OF_ART); University of Minnesota Press (ORG); 2020 (DATE); Catherine D’Ignazio (PERSON); Data Feminism (WORK_OF_ART); MIT Press (WORK_OF_ART); 2020 (DATE); Matthew K.

Challenges and Solutions for a Digital Edition""Featuring Dr. Benedetta Bessiwith the support of Dr. Daniele Fusi",Text Technologies Workshop with Benedetta Bessi on Mapping the Aegean,"Text Technologies at CESTA announces the next event in the Text Technologies Workshop Series: ""Mapping the Aegean: the Liber Insularum by Cristoforo Buondelmonti . Challenges and Solutions for a Digital Edition"" Featuring Dr. Benedetta Bessi with the support of Dr. Daniele Fusi MapAeg is aimed at the study and the promotion of knowledge of the Liber Insularum Archipelagi (1420) by the Florentine traveler Cristoforo Buondelmonti. This book can be considered the first guide to the Greek islands, each of them described by a textual paragraph and illustrated by colour maps, in a format which gave rise to the new literary genre of Isolaria . The goal of the project is the creation of a digital edition of this text based on the ms Gennadios Library, Athens, 71, a manuscript presenting the full Latin text illustrated with good quality illustrations of all the islands. The edition includes a facsimile, transcription and an English translation and is accompanied by a commentary which addresses geographical, historical and archaeological questions. An important component is represented by the annotations of the map drawings and their connection to GIS. Given the intrinsic, highly multi-disciplinary nature of this work, and the potential for its growth well beyond its original boundaries, we need a technological approach which, way beyond a text-based digital edition, best ensures the possibility of stacking more and more layers of specialized information about the edited text, at any time during or even after the project completion. This will allow starting with an essential set of metadata, and progressively increase and specialize it with eventual contributions from different scholars. About the Speakers: Benedetta Bessi is a Classical archaeologist (PhD, Greek and  Roman Archaeology and History of Art from the University of Messina) interested in the cultural history of the ancient Mediterranean, history of archaeology and digital humanities. She is a Visiting Postdoctoral Fellow of Stanford’s Department of Classics and a European Community Marie Sklodowska-Curie Research Fellow.Daniele Fusi is currently a research fellow in digital text at the Venice Center of Digital and Public Humanities of the Ca 'Foscari University of Venice. After his doctorate in Greek and Latin philology, he conducted teaching and research activities in the field of digital humanities, especially at the University of Rome Sapienza. As a full-stack professional developer he carried out a decades-long consultancy activity in design and development of software and corpora, especially for academic institutions and publishing houses.

Using topic modeling in tandem with network analysis, I read two modern Chinese novels: Second Sun by Liu Baiyu (1987) and Soul Mountain by Gao Xingjian (1990) and reveal how their authors avail themselves of the sublime in order to make performative statements about the world.

Zephyr Frank teaches Latin American and transnational history at Stanford University.  His research interests include studies of economic inequality, spatial history, the relation between literary and social history, environmental history, and the digital humanities.  His most recent book, Reading Rio de Janeiro: Literature and Society in the Nineteenth Century was published in 2016 by Stanford University Press.  He is currently working on a related book on theater and society, as well as an NSF-sponsored study of land use in Latin American cities. This event will be chaired by Laura Stokes, Associate Professor of History at Stanford. The Stanford respondent will be William Parish and the UCL respondent will be Madeline Tondi.  This is the third event in the Digital Humanities Long View, a joint seminar series co-hosted by the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) at Stanford and UCL's Centre for Digital Humanities that explores the history of DH and how this past informs the future of digital humanist methods.","Tue February 23rd 2021, 12:00 - 1:30pm",Virtual,Zephyr Frank (PERSON); Digital Humanities and Spatial History: Atlantic World Stories' | Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis     Zephyr Frank on 'Digital Humanities and Spatial History: Atlantic World Stories' (WORK_OF_ART); Rio de Janeiro (GPE); Digital Humanities (ORG); three (CARDINAL); Brazilian (NORP); Zephyr Frank (PERSON); Latin American (NORP); Stanford University (ORG); Reading Rio de Janeiro: Literature and Society in the Nineteenth Century (WORK_OF_ART); 2016 (DATE); Stanford University Press (ORG); NSF (ORG); Latin American (NORP); Laura Stokes (PERSON); Stanford (ORG); Stanford (ORG); William Parish (PERSON); UCL (ORG); Madeline Tondi (PERSON); third (ORDINAL); the Digital Humanities Long View (WORK_OF_ART); the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (ORG); CESTA (ORG); Stanford (ORG); UCL's Centre for Digital Humanities (ORG); DH (WORK_OF_ART),"Zephyr Frank, Zephyr Frank, Laura Stokes, William Parish, Madeline Tondi","Zephyr Frank, Madeline Tondi, William Parish, Laura Stokes"

The labor of these Chinese workers (who eventually numbered between 10-12,000 at any one moment) was central to creating the wealth that Leland Stanford used to found Stanford University. But these workers have never received the attention they deserve. We know relatively little about their lives. What led them to come to the United States? What experiences did they have in their arduous work? How did they live their daily lives? What kinds of communities did they create? How did their work on the railroad change the lives of their families in China and how did it change the lives of the workers themselves? The Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project seeks to give a voice to the Chinese migrants whose labor on the Transcontinental Railroad helped to shape the physical and social landscape of the American West. To this end, the project has developed a wide array of digital research methods and infrastructure—including archives, interactive maps, oral histories, and materials for teachers—and combined them with historical analysis to create a novel resource for those wishing to understand the history of the Chinese railroad workers. In this talk, the first in the CESTA Digital Humanities Public Lecture Series, Stanford Professor of History Gordon Chang and Dr. Roland Hsu , Director of Research of the project, will discuss the history of the Chinese railroad workers and describe the key findings and stories unearthed by this influential digital humanities project.","Tue November 17th 2020, 12:00pm",Zoom Webinar: https://stanford.zoom.us/webinar/93280857767,"Gordon Chang (PERSON); Roland Hsu (PERSON); the Chinese Railroad Workers (ORG); North America Project (ORG); Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (ORG); 1864 (DATE); 1869 (DATE); thousands (CARDINAL); Chinese (NORP); America’s first Transcontinental Railroad (ORG); Chinese (NORP); between 10-12,000 (CARDINAL); Leland Stanford (PERSON); Stanford University (ORG); the United States (GPE); Gordon Chang (PERSON); Roland Hsu (PERSON); the Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project (ORG); 1864 (DATE); 1869 (DATE); thousands (CARDINAL); Chinese (NORP); America’s first Transcontinental Railroad (ORG); Chinese (NORP); between 10-12,000 (CARDINAL); Leland Stanford (PERSON); Stanford University (ORG); the United States (GPE); China (GPE); The Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project (ORG); Chinese (NORP); the Transcontinental Railroad (ORG); American (NORP); Chinese (NORP); first (ORDINAL); the CESTA Digital Humanities Public Lecture Series (EVENT); Stanford (ORG); Gordon Chang (PERSON); Roland Hsu (PERSON); Chinese (NORP)","Gordon Chang, Roland Hsu, Leland Stanford, Gordon Chang, Roland Hsu, Leland Stanford, Gordon Chang, Roland Hsu","Roland Hsu, Gordon Chang, Leland Stanford"

These land grant maps, or mapas de mercedes de tierra, tell the stories of hundreds of Natives and Spaniards who engaged in legal proceedings either to request land, to oppose a petition, or to negotiate its terms. Ana Pulido Rull spent various years examining these striking painted maps and reading the court records from the land disputes at the Mexican National Archives.In this online talk, the author will narrate some of the stories she found most remarkable and will show that these maps did more than simply record the disputed territories for lawsuits: They also enabled indigenous communities to translate their ideas about the contested spaces into visual form; offered arguments for the defense of these spaces; and, in some cases, even helped protect indigenous land against harmful requests.

He will be talking about global trends and rhetorics of cancel culture, and analysis of the dissemination of this cultural phenomenon as well as networks of people and institutions involved in cancelling and being cancelled utilizing methods of text mining and data visualizations. This presentation is in anticipation of his upcominng book with Stanford University Press (September 2024), The Cancel Culture Panic: How an American Obsession Went Global . Lunch will be served during the event,and there is a Zoom option available as well. Please RSVP via this link to receive the Zoom information. About Adrian Daub Adrian Daub is the Barbara D. Finberg Director of the Clayman Institute, a position he began in 2019. He is the J. E. Wallace Sterling Professor of the Humanities and a professor of comparative literature and German studies in the School of Humanities and Sciences. He writes about politics, literature, culture, and universities for German and Swiss newspapers and for Anglo-American outlets. Together with Laura Goode, he hosts the Clayman Institute’s podcast, The Feminist Present , which features interviews with a range of feminist voices. For the podcast In Bed With the Right, Moira Donegan and Daub welcome scholars and critics to analyze right wing ideas about gender, sex and sexuality – and to plumb the ways in which these ideas persist in and shape our present moment. His recent book, What the Ballad Knows: The Ballad Genre, Memory Culture, and German Nationalism, provides a thorough history of the ballad at the intersection of literary, musical, and visual arts, showing how the German ballad subverted and complicated the national project during the 19th century. A book in German, Cancel Culture Transfer: How a Moral Panic is Gripping the World , was published in November 2022. The Dynastic Imagination: Family and Modernity in Nineteenth-Century Germany offers an unexpected account of modern German intellectual history through frameworks of family and kinship. In 2020, he published What Tech Calls Thinking , an examination of the intellectual underpinnings of Silicon Valley and the tech industry. Together with Charles Kronengold he wrote The James Bond Songs: Pop Anthems of Late Capitalism. Daub’s research focuses on the intersection of literature, music and philosophy, particularly in the 19th century. His book Uncivil Unions - The Metaphysics of Marriage in German Idealism and Romanticism explores German philosophical theories of marriage from Kant to Nietzsche. His book Tristan's Shadow - Sexuality and the Total Work of Art deals with eroticism in German opera after Wagner. Four-Handed Monsters ties the practice of four-hand piano playing to ideologies about gender, labor, and the family in nineteenth-century Europe. In addition, he has published articles on opera, film, and poetry, as well as literature and scandal.","Tue April 16th 2024, 12:00 - 1:15pm","Wallenberg Hall, Room 433A","The Case of ‘Cancel Culture’ | Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (WORK_OF_ART); Tuesday, April 16th, between 12 (DATE); 1:15 pm (TIME); Adrian Daub (PERSON); Using Wikipedia to Understand the Digital Global Public Sphere and Its Discontents: The Case of ‘Cancel Culture’"" (WORK_OF_ART); The Case of ‘Cancel Culture (WORK_OF_ART); Tuesday, April 16th (DATE); between 12 and 1:15 pm (TIME); Adrian Daub (PERSON); Using Wikipedia to Understand the Digital Global Public Sphere and Its Discontents: The Case of ‘Cancel Culture’"" (WORK_OF_ART); Stanford University Press (ORG); September 2024 (DATE); The Cancel Culture Panic: How an American Obsession Went Global (WORK_OF_ART); Zoom (PRODUCT); Zoom (PRODUCT); Adrian Daub (PERSON); Adrian Daub (PERSON); Barbara D.

Digital imagery has long been held accountable for effacing the indexicality of cinema’s photographic base, while post-cinematic images more generally might be thought in terms of their “discorrelation” from viewing subjects: audiovisual contents are severed from subjective perception and from the phenomenological frameworks according to which cinematic sounds and images were traditionally calibrated with human embodiment. Such discorrelation is pervasive in our networked computational media environment, where images are generated on the fly via microtemporal processes inaccessible to human perception, but it is nowhere more evident than in the digital glitches and “artifacts” that mark and disrupt the video streams we consume on our digital devices. Glitches thus announce to us the ruins of contemporary perception – but they also signal an expansion of the domain and the material efficacy of sub- or supra-personal affect. Looking particularly at the ways that digital glitches have been implemented in recent movies, video, and media art, this presentation argues that new forms of sensibility and collectivity may become thinkable in the spaces opened up by post-cinematic media – that new ways of being and relating to the world may arise from the ruins of perception.

Short presentations on work-in-progress will be followed by open discussion. Join the virtual gathering via Zoom . Social Networks and Geographical Mobility in the Han Empire Yunxin Li (Graduate Student, History) I will introduce how I have used social network analysis to study the politics of the Han empire, discuss my current work on the geographical mobility of Han officials, and finally talk about how I plan to combine network analysis with spatial data. Mapping Geographical Knowledge in the Middle East Adrien Zakar & Merve Tekgurler (History) Hundreds of geographical books and illustrations have been produced in Arabic and Ottoman-Turkish since the late 18th-century. This body of spatial knowledge comprises both geography, information concerning life on earth usually portrayed as points, lines, and polygons, and cosmography, theories about the earth’s position in the universe represented as circles. The proliferation of geographical language and tools two centuries ago reflected the rise of the territorialized nation-state, intensifying militarization, and sweep capitalization of Middle Eastern economies. Atlases, compendiums, and treatises are an invaluable source for studying these processes as they unfolded in the MEASA region. Despite the value of such a corpus, its sheer scale has long deterred researchers from exploiting its evolution across time. This project aims to offer an open archive that gathers together the extent of modern geographical works into a user-friendly map comprised of three main layers which will visualize where each work was produced, what locations they depicted, and where these works can be found today. This map builds on a dataset of geographical publications in Arabic and Turkish, with occasional insertions of relevant materials in other languages including Urdu, Persian, French, English, and German. These include works explicitly titled, “geography,” “cosmography” and “atlas” as well as a plethora of vernacular genres in spatial analysis such as ""Salname"" [Almanac] “Khiṭaṭ” [Plans] “Cihannuma” [Book of the Earth] and “Kitab al-ʿAjaʾib” [Book of Wonders] among others. The dataset builds on existing printed repositories of references, such as Ekemeleddin Ihsanoğlu’s two volume “Osmanlı  Coğrafya Literatürü Tarihi” (History of Ottoman Geographical Literature). Peter Broadwell (Digital Scholarship Developer, CIDR) K-pop dance performances, particularly those of corporate and government-sponsored “idol” groups, are a key component of K-pop’s core mission of projecting soft power internationally. Consequently, thousands of K-pop music videos and official “dance practice” recordings are readily available via online video platforms, where they often garner millions of views. While there are well-known choreographers who work with K-pop production companies, there is little documentation of the choreography beyond the dance videos themselves. The recent advent of deep learning-based pose detection methods that can reliably detect human body/limb positions from video frames makes possible computational studies that use these videos as primary sources for “distant viewing” (as well as close viewing) analyses. This talk outlines work done to date to detect and quantify synchronized poses, concerted motion (“tightness”), and recurrent poses and motions in specific videos, contributing to the development of a typography of K-pop dance idioms that can facilitate a data-driven study of the constitutive interdependence of K-pop and other cultural genres.

We were in the best position ever for this change, in large part because we had been working with CESTA since winter planning a digital map to supplement our physical exhibit. But it was no simple “pivot” moving student curation online. It demanded a wholesale redesign of course content and project goals. Despite my best intentions, a modest exhibit became an ambitious digital publication. Modeling Mesoamerica is an exciting project demonstrating the critical potential of our most underappreciated collections and the vitality of online publication. But it also required more than anticipated from everybody involved. This project illuminates larger issues of resources, mission, and digital learning curves that face museums as we increasingly “go digital” with formal and informal learning. Christina J. Hodge is Academic Curator and Collections Manager of the Stanford University Archaeology Collections (SUAC) of the Stanford Archaeology Center. She is an interdisciplinary museum anthropologist and historical archaeologist working in critical museum and heritage studies. Modeling Mesoamerica is a collaborative project featuring artifacts from SUAC’s permanent collection. Artifact digitization was undertaken by the Stanford Libraries Digital Production Group, especially Tony Calavano and Dinah Handel. Curatorial content was developed by SUAC staff, who are Sara Godin, Christina J. Hodge, Suzy Huizinga, and Veronica Jacobs-Edmondson; and students, including student research assistant Medora Rorick and the student curators of the spring 2020 course Museum Cultures: Material Representation in the Past and Present.

Researchers in every field of study have access to far more data than could have been imagined even a decade ago. The scale and speed of data creation has opened up exciting new paths of inquiry while also introducing new kinds of data bias and challenges. Data science has made significant advances in computational and mathematical tools to organize and analyze data, recognize patterns and make predictions at scale. The digital humanities are also concerned with scale, but focus on how we reduce historical and literary sources into data representations that are ripe for computation. Libraries and archives that produce metadata, define collections, and trace provenance, all to provide meaningful context, are in need of more powerful tools to support the production of new knowledge. This state of things provides an opportunity, and perhaps faces us with an imperative, to learn from each other across theoretical and methodological divides, and to address the social, ethical, and political implications of the boundlessness of data today. Stanford PhD candidates and recent recipients from disciplines across campus will participate in a challenge that includes selected paper presentations and group workshopping of those papers through the lens of issues in data practices. The event will culminate in a discussion and review of the workshopping sessions findings with faculty and library staff. The application deadline passed on Sept. 6.

The Early Modern Digital Itineraries (EmDigIt) Converter Tool translates select guides to mileage and currency conversions into a web platform for use by students and researchers. This presentation will address the challenges of translating premodern sources into a reconciled dataset and clear user interface, while indicating the hermeneutic benefit for understanding the early modern information environment.

She will be starting as an assistant professor of digital history at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in August. In her research, she brings twenty-first-century understanding of media and social networks to the political and cultural history of the early modern period. She has previously worked as a senior graduate research fellow at CESTA, and collaborated on the Grand Tour and Early Modern Mobility projects. Her work appears in collected volumes such as T he Renaissance of Letters: knowledge and community in Italy, 1300-1650 and Empires of Knowledge: scientific networks in the early modern w orld.

In response to the current pandemic, we are analyzing recent news sources while we simultaneously explore historical newspaper coverage for analogs of other diseases. We’re particularly interested in the language of care and safety: in epidemic conditions, who gets to care? Who gets personified or erased? While we ponder these questions of public rhetoric, we’ve also begun an investigation into social distancing and the novel of isolation. Does the way that we describe isolation in literary contexts change according to the gender of the characters, whether it is voluntary or not, or whether the distancing happens alone or in groups? By exploring the ways in which novels have confronted the experience of social distancing, we seek to gain a better understanding of our own moment.

Civilian settlers from closely related families were drawn to the new colony of Nuevo Santander from surrounding areas of northeastern Mexico, where they had lived for centuries. Lured by new land grants along the Rio Grande and in the “wild horse desert” below the Nueces river, they occupied a frontier that had not yet become a borderland and brought with them a well-established Spanish ranching tradition. This early-stage study uses digital methods to understand the origins of the families who settled in the Villas del Norte ; to uncover their relationships with each other and to the early history of northeastern New Spain; and to identify their legacy in the increasingly at-risk material culture of the region’s architecture.

Algee-Hewitt ""The Afterlife of Aesthetics"""," Prof. Mark Algee-Hewitt will join us to present: ""The Afterlife of Aesthetics"" In this presentation, Prof. Algee-Hewitt combines quantitative and critical analyses to explore how aesthetic concepts evolved over the course of the long eighteenth century. Focusing particularly on the concept of the sublime, as well as on the related ideas of the picturesque, grotesque and beautiful, his project examines how these central terms emerged from a confluence of discourses into what became the aesthetic theory of the eighteenth century. Using a combination of word embedding analysis and information theory on a corpus of over 320,000 texts written between 1660 and 1860, he traces both the large-scale developments in the discourse that led to the sudden disappearance of the sublime in the early nineteenth-century, and, by tracking its embedding into smaller scale of individual literary texts, he also offers an explanation for its absence from nineteenth and twentieth-century aesthetic discourse even as it became a foundational term in the professional work of criticism. Mark Algee-Hewitt is an Assistant Professor of English and Digital Humanities, as well as the Director of the Stanford Literary Lab. His work applies computational methods to corpora of texts in order to explore questions of interest to literary studies and the humanities more broadly. His current work focuses on the aesthetic theory of the long eighteenth-century, particularly in the intersections between philosophic discourse and literature. In the Literary Lab, he leads a number of projects on a variety of literary and non-literary topics, including projects on the narrative theory of short stories, the ways in which novels make use of extra-literary discourse, how which literary texts assign, or deny, personhood to human and non-human characters, and the use of harsh language as an enforcement mechanism by the OECD’s working group on bribery.","Tue April 21st 2020, 12:00 - 1:00pm",broadcast live via zoom,"M.

Mazzini ""Hams, phreaks, hackers: a genealogy of participatory cultures..."""," Federico Mazzini will join us to present: ""Hams, phreaks, hackers: a genealogy of participatory cultures in the XX century"" Hacking and what H. Jenkins called “participatory cultures” are often seen as recent phenomena, born with the diffusion of personal computers in the 1980s and the commercialization of the Internet in the 1990s. This paper will show that many aspects of what is now called “hacker culture” (its hands-on approach, its recruitment and collaboration practices, its sociability, its gender, social and age composition and even its humor and political stance) are to be found in technology enthusiasts’ communities well before the “digital revolution”. In particular the paper will compare what we know today of hacker and maker cultures with two other “technical cultures” (K. Haring): radio enthusiasts (hams) at the beginning of the XX century, as they appear from U.S. popularization magazines, and phone enthusiasts (phreaks) in the 60s and 70s, studied through their fanzines and newsletters. The paper will then suggest a long-period genealogy of hacker and participatory cultures and it will argue that the ideas of free-of-charge, anonymous participation in a collective technological endeavor and grass-root creation of specialized knowledge were not born with the Open Source, Wikipedia or Maker movements, but are a long-standing part of the relationship between end-users and consumer technology in the Anglo-Saxon world. Federico Mazzini teaches Digital History at the University of Padova and is coordinator of the Digital Laboratory for Mobility Research (MOBILAB) at the same university. He researched the cultural history of World War One through popular writings, with a focus on the peasant experience of the trenches. His research was published as a monograph (“ Cose de laltro mondo. Una cultura di guerra attraverso la scrittura popolare trentina” ) in 2013. He subsequently wrote about the history of technoscientific mass popularization during World War One (“ Una guerra di meraviglie ?”, 2018) and technical cultures (phreakers and hackers in particular) in the 20th century. His varied works and interests are linked together by the interest in textual and rhetorical strategies as access points to cultural representations.","Tue February 25th 2020, 12:00 - 1:20pm","CESTA Seminar Room (Bldg. 160, Rm. 433A)",F.

Between roughly 1850 and 1905, thousands of men, women, and children obtained freedom. Many approached French colonial officials to codify their legal status, adding their name, age, gender, time and place of birth, and date and location of liberation to governmental records. This paper discusses an ongoing project that takes a digital approach to working with these sources, now part of the collection of the Archives Nationales du Sénégal . We take demographic data from these liberation records, and ultimately, we plan to construct a visualization of slave liberations, as well as build a database over nearly 30,000 entries. In so doing, we propose a methodology that foregrounds the experiences of enslaved individuals and demonstrates how colonial archival sources keen insight into their experiences and actions.

She was a 2018-2019 Digital Humanities Graduate Research Fellow at CESTA.

Situating the SF Nexus within a theoretical shift in the digital humanities that recognizes the constructed nature of corpora, data modeling, and visualization, this talk will outline the project's curation of a copyrighted dataset through all stages of the data life cycle. Presented as a model for its expansion into a collaborative, multi-institutional project, this presentation will overview the digitization of SF novels and magazines, their ingestion and preservation in HathiTrust's Digital Library, their curation through extracted feature sets online, and the development of a legal and technical framework for a distributed system of localized access centers in participating libraries. The presentation will conclude by exploring a new wave of digital curation and analysis, inspired by the collections as data movement, speculating on what can be learned from recent innovations in machine learning for vector space modeling to study the politics of world-building in ""New Wave"" speculative fiction.

Based on this data, we can study the discussion regarding digital policy in this subfield of the public sphere and compare it with discourse in traditional media settings (newspaper corpora ) and the policy discussion ( corpus of parliamentary debates). Our goal is to identify the most influential contributors, their communication strategies, and the arguments they bring forward. What are the challenges that these stakeholders detect with regards to the impact of digital technologies on democracy and to what extent do they differ from those recognized on the other side of the Atlantic?

While readers and viewers have roughly the same point of departure (particularly in the wake of the film releases, which curtailed earlier liberties in translation), the fan fiction responses to that material diverge in ways that are shaped by shaped by language and culture (both national cultures and the community cultures of particular fanfic archives). In this talk, we will discuss how the affordances and conventions of three archives (Italian efpfanfic.net , Russian ficbook.net , and primarily-English fanfiction.net ), and the languages and cultures of their writers, have contributed to differences ranging from rating and genre to warnings, characters, and pairings. We will also reflect on the challenges inherent to examining fanfic as a literary phenomenon — both in terms of the magnitude of the material, and the manner of engaging with active communities of readers and writers whose interests, values, and priorities may differ from scholars with an academic interest in fanfic. Quinn Dombrowski is the Academic Technology Specialist in the Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages and the Center for Digital Interdisciplinary Research in the Stanford University Libraries.

Medieval manuscripts occupy a space at the intersection of history, art, music, and literary studies. These richly complex objects invite interdisciplinary and multi-faceted study and, for the last two years, Stanford scholars have been fortunate to have a world-class collection of Italian manuscript materials on deposit and available for research and teaching. The Burke Collection of Early Italian Miniatures brings together forty-one examples showcasing the splendour of manuscript painting in Italy from the 13th through the 15th centuries. The symposium coincides with the opening of an exhibit in Green Library in the Munger Rotunda and Peterson Gallery: The Illuminated Page: Manuscripts from the Burke Collection, 1150-1550 . Symposium : 1:00 to 5:30 pm All are welcome to join us! After the symposium, there will be a reception and concert, Sounds of Renaissance Florence , by Professor Jesse Rodin, his students, and his ensemble Cut Circle , which will focus on the music from a choirbook from the parish at Santa Maria sopra Porta in Florence.

Joining us will be Professor Mohamed Cheriet, Director of Synchromedia Laboratory at the University of Quebec’s École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS). Our workshop’s focus on “Uncertainty in AI Situations” asks researchers to consider what AI can do when faced with uncertainty. Machine learning algorithms whose classifications rely on posterior probabilities of membership often present ambiguous results, where due to unavailable training data or ambiguous cases, the likelihood of any outcome is approximately even. In such situations, the human programmers must decide how the machine handles ambiguity: whether making a “best-fit” classification or reporting potential error, there is always a potential conflict between the mathematical rigor of the model and the ambiguity of real-world use cases. Since Humanists, in particular, are adept, and professionally skilled, at working with interpretative paradigms that are neither right nor wrong, our insights into uncertainty, ambiguity, and indecision are crucial to AI research and development. Moreover, in working in depth on irony and satire —genres that are deliberately ambiguous and indeterminate—or on color description —one of the most ambiguous of all linguistic and conceptual categories—this research workshop will discuss the attributes of unclarity at multiple levels to help us frame and advance more effective questions that take uncertainty into account. We shall ask: Our workshop will begin the process of advancing AI to a new intellectual understanding of one of the trickiest problems in the machine-learning environment.

We’ve got a great line-up of workshops, lightning talks and speakers in celebration of Geography Week. Keynote: ""Trafficking and Tech: How Satellite imagery, radio comms and vessel broadcasts freed 2,000+ slaves"" - Martha Mendoza / Associated PressFrom documenting war crimes to freeing slaves, Journalists today are tapping GIS data to investigate and report powerful news. In this presentation, Pulitzer prize winning journalist Martha Mendoza takes us through the tech behind the story that tracked fish caught by enslaved men in Southeast Asia to American dinner tables. AP reporter Martha Mendoza takes you behind the scenes of her four-woman team's investigation from discovering a slave island to tracking boats at sea with high resolutions cameras on satellite. Hear about the tech behind the journalism that resulted in a dozen people jailed, ships worth millions of dollars seized and businesses shut down. There were U.S. Congressional hearings, lawsuits and new legislation signed by the president. Some of the world's largest companies promised reforms. And consumers worldwide were forced to confront the cruelties of slavery in the 21st century. https://www.ap.org/explore/seafood-from-slaves A two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, Martha Mendoza’s reports have prompted Congressional hearings and new legislation, Pentagon investigations and White House responses. She was part of a team whose investigations into slavery in the Thai seafood sector have led to the freedom of more than 2000 men. During her Associated Press career, she’s been based in Mexico City, Bangkok, Silicon Valley, New York and New Mexico. She’s an advocate for accurate journalism, government transparency and the public’s right to know.

With this seminar on ‘Recuperating Forgotten Narratives’ we focus on what happens to text when it is digitized and turned into data. What new possibilities open up with this type of textual data? What new narratives can be written about past and present textual traditions? What remains irretrievable? This is the fifth event in the Mellon Sawyer Seminar series, The Data that Divides Us: Recalibrating Data Methods for New Knowledge Frameworks Across the Humanities, generously funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. During Stanford University's 2023-24 academic year, the Sawyer Seminar Series will convene scholars from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and personal standpoints to discuss the data that has saturated our world. Professor Marlene Daut will talk about how digitizing and making accessible early 19th-century Haitian print culture can act as a kind of counter-exhibit, both to actual exhibits and in general to the way that Haiti is portrayed across various types of media. Following the talk, there will be a response by Matt Randolph (PhD candidate in History at Stanford). If you cannot attend in person, you can register for a Zoom link here . Marlene L. Daut is Professor of French and African American Studies at Yale University. Her books include Tropics of Haiti: Race and the Literary History of the Haitian Revolution in the Atlantic World; Baron de Vastey and the Origins of Black Atlantic Humanism; and Awakening the Ashes: An Intellectual History of the Haitian Revolution . Her articles on Haitian history and culture have appeared in The New Yorker, The New York Times , Harper’s Bazaar , Essence , The Nation , and the LA Review of Book s . She has won several awards, grants, and fellowships for her contributions to historical and cultural understandings of the Caribbean, notably from the Ford Foundation, the American Council of Learned Societies, the Haitian Studies Association, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Most recently, she won a grant from the Robert Silvers Foundation for her forthcoming biography, The First and Last King of Haiti: The Rise and Fall of Henry Christophe. She is also co-creator and co-editor of H-Net Commons’ digital platform, H-Haiti with Julia Gaffield and curator of a website on early Haitian print culture at http://lagazetteroyale.com ; see also her online bibliography of fictions of the Haitian Revolution from 1787 to 1900 at the website http://haitianrevolutionaryfictions.com","Mon April 8th 2024, 5:30 - 6:30pm","Building 160, Wallenberg Hall 450 Jane Stanford Way, Building 160, Stanford, CA 94305 433A","Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series: Recuperating Forgotten Narratives (WORK_OF_ART); Marlene Daut (WORK_OF_ART); Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis Previous (WORK_OF_ART); 19th-century (DATE); Recuperating Forgotten Narratives (WORK_OF_ART); Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series: Recuperating Forgotten Narratives (WORK_OF_ART); Marlene Daut (PERSON); 19th-century (DATE); Recuperating Forgotten Narratives (WORK_OF_ART); fifth (ORDINAL); Mellon Sawyer Seminar (ORG); The Data that Divides Us: Recalibrating Data Methods for New Knowledge Frameworks Across the Humanities (WORK_OF_ART); the Andrew W.

Dr. Agnieszka Backman will present: ""Using Socio Semiotic Analysis on Medieval Manuscript Platforms""  Abstract:  Digitizing medieval manuscripts is often advertised as a way to make them more accessible, but it also changes what you can do with them. Using socio semiotic theory and method I will be doing a multimodal analysis of three platforms containing medieval Swedish manuscripts, Alvin (Alvin-portal.org), Handrit.is, and Manuscripta.se, as a first step to study the affordances of these platforms. Affordances, what a design allows you to do, are often discussed when it comes to platforms with medieval manuscripts but are seldom defined or analyzed in any detail. Digital affordances frame manuscripts differently than physical collections and the three platforms are examples of how different perspectives and software solutions impact the meaning potential of manuscripts. About the speaker: Agnieszka Backman is a new Wallenberg Postdoctoral Fellow working in Text Technologies. Her project is on materialities of medieval manuscripts on digital platforms from a multimodal, socio semiotic perspective. By comparing the affordances of physical manuscripts vs. digitized ones, she will show the effects digitization has on the meaning of manuscripts. Agnieszka finished her PhD on the materiality of a Swedish medieval manuscript, D 3, also called Fru Elin’s bok ‘Lady Elin’s book’, in 2017 at Uppsala University. For the last two years she has worked in The Norse perception of the world project ( www.uu.se/norseworld ), which is mapping foreign place names in medieval Swedish and Danish vernacular texts.

Dr. Rowan Dorin, Thawsitt Naing, and Clara Romani will present: ""Corpus Synodalium: Mapping Law (and Resistance) in Late Medieval Europe"" Abstract: The bishops of late medieval Europe issued thousands of laws, on subjects ranging from the regulation of midwives to the tithing of livestock, and even on what to do if a spider fell into the communion wine. Yet despite the value ofthis legal corpus as a source for the social and religious history of the late Middle Ages, its sheer scale (to say nothingof the challenges of scattered manuscripts, indecipherable handwriting, linguistic variety, and messy textual trans-mission) has long deterred scholars from exploiting its riches. In this talk, we will present Corpus Synodalium, a new online database that gathers together the extant corpus of medieval episcopal legislation into a user-friendly platform that supports a range of text analysis tools as well as an innovative mapping function. The talk will be of particular interest to scholars working with non-English or multilingual sources, as well as those seeking to integrate spatial visualizations into textual research. Bios: Rowan Dorin has been an Assistant Professor of History at Stanford since 2017, and is the project leader for the Corpus Synodalium project. His research and teaching focus primarily on western Europe and the Mediterranean during the Middle Ages (500-1500 CE), and he is currently working on two books, the first exploring the rise of mass expulsion in late medieval Europe, and the second examining the ways in which religious law was adapted or resisted in local contexts in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. He has also published articles on Mediterranean trade networks, crusader art, and the production of medieval manuscripts. Thawsitt Naing is a recent Stanford CS grad (class of 2019). He was the lead developer for the Corpus Synodalium database and mapping visualization websites. Currently, he is working on building delightful and accessible user interfaces at ThoughtSpot. Clara Romani is a senior double majoringin History and French with a minor in Italian.

Dr. Haifeng Hui (惠海峰 ) is Professor of English at the School of Foreign Languages, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China. He researches children’s literature from diverse theoretical perspectives, including narratology, stylistics, adaptation studies, and digital humanities. He serves as an Advisor Board member of International Research in Children's Literature, and an editor of Jeunesse: Young People, Texts, Cultures. He received his B.A. (2003), M.A. (2006) and Ph.D. (2012) from Peking University. He is also a visiting scholar at University of California at Los Angeles (2014-2015). Haifeng’s recent publications include Adaptation of British Literary Classics for Children (Peking University Press, 2019), “Canon Studies in China: Traditions, Modernization and Revisions in the Global Context,” Poetics Today (2021), “Embedded Mental States in Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief and Uneven Distribution of Narratorial Attention,” Orbis Litterarrum (2023), “What Can Digital Humanities Do for Literary Adaptation Studies: Distant Reading of Children's Editions of Robinson Crusoe,” Digital Scholarship in the Humanities (2023). Abstract of the Paper While topic modeling has been widely used in NLP tasks, its application to literary texts has encountered challenges and dilemmas. In this seminar, I will begin by conducting topic modeling on a single novel, Robinson Crusoe , as a case study to demonstrate how we can use topic modeling for fiction analysis with the help of word2vec to differentiate different topic words in space, which makes it easier to interpret their significances. The result is further validated by readings of different editions of the novel through topic modeling. In the next step, I will apply topic modeling to the history of eighteenth-century English fiction, where I have found an interesting phenomenon of the topic of 'cry'. Following this clue, I have studied the evolution of emotional expression in English novels in the 18th century. By using BookNLP, I extract the usage of nouns and verbs related to emotions and feelings over the course of time, and explore how this trend is influenced by gender. The digital evidence amassed in this research contributes to understanding issues concerning the emergence of sentimentalism and emotions in literary works.","Tue April 2nd 2024, 12:00 - 1:15pm","Wallenberg Hall, Room 433A","Haifeng Hui (PERSON); eighteenth-century (DATE); English (LANGUAGE); Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis Join (WORK_OF_ART); April 2nd (DATE); between 12 and 1:30 pm (TIME); ""Topic modeling and BookNLP: Seeking the emotional turn in the history of (WORK_OF_ART); eighteenth-century (DATE); English (LANGUAGE); Haifeng Hui (PERSON); School of Foreign Languages (ORG); Huazhong University of Science and Technology (ORG); China (GPE); Hui (PERSON); Center for East Asian Studies (ORG); Stanford (ORG); CESTA (ORG); Haifeng Hui (PERSON); eighteenth-century (DATE); English (LANGUAGE); first (ORDINAL); Robinson Crusoe"" (WORK_OF_ART); Hui (PERSON); April 2nd (DATE); between 12 and 1:30 pm (TIME); "" Topic modeling and BookNLP: Seeking the emotional turn in the history of (WORK_OF_ART); eighteenth-century (DATE); English (LANGUAGE); Haifeng Hui (PERSON); School of Foreign Languages (ORG); Huazhong University of Science and Technology (ORG); China (GPE); Hui (PERSON); Center for East Asian Studies (ORG); Stanford (ORG); CESTA (ORG); RSVP (ORG); Zoom (PRODUCT); Haifeng Hui (PERSON); English (LANGUAGE); the School of Foreign Languages (ORG); Huazhong University of Science and Technology (ORG); China (GPE); International Research in Children's Literature (ORG); Jeunesse (ORG); B.A. (WORK_OF_ART); 2003 (DATE); M.A. (WORK_OF_ART); 2006 (DATE); Ph.D. (WORK_OF_ART); 2012 (DATE); Peking University (ORG); University of California at Los Angeles (ORG); 2014-2015 (DATE); Haifeng’s (PERSON); Adaptation of British Literary Classics for Children (WORK_OF_ART); Peking University Press (ORG); 2019 (DATE); Canon Studies in China: Traditions, Modernization and Revisions in the Global Context (WORK_OF_ART); Poetics Today (WORK_OF_ART); 2021 (DATE); Embedded Mental States in Percy Jackson (WORK_OF_ART); the Lightning Thief (WORK_OF_ART); Uneven Distribution of Narratorial Attention (WORK_OF_ART); Orbis Litterarrum (WORK_OF_ART); 2023 (DATE); What Can Digital Humanities Do for Literary Adaptation Studies (WORK_OF_ART); Distant Reading of Children's Editions of Robinson Crusoe (WORK_OF_ART); Digital Scholarship in the Humanities (WORK_OF_ART); 2023 (DATE); Robinson Crusoe (WORK_OF_ART); eighteenth-century (DATE); English (LANGUAGE); English (LANGUAGE); the 18th century (DATE); BookNLP (WORK_OF_ART)","Haifeng Hui, Haifeng Hui, Hui, Haifeng Hui, Hui, Haifeng Hui, Hui, Haifeng Hui, Haifeng’s",Haifeng Hui

Ph.D. Candidate Rachel Midura will present:  “ Itinerated Europe: Early Modern Place & Space in Printed Itineraries, 1545-1747 ”  Abstract: This project brings together spatial and digital network analysis to explore a database of sixteenth through eighteenth-century printed itineraries. Before the advent of modern cartography, the itinerary was the height of geographic knowledge. Lists of cities and their relative distances opened European travel to a broad readership. By the mid-sixteenth century, private and public individuals carried such guides to navigate state networks of mounted couriers and staging posts. The itinerary database offers the ability to model a European “mental map,” preserving important directionality, hierarchization, and structural change over time. Using the case studies of Rome, Lyon, and London, I provide new periodization for changing European space in early modern print. Bio: Rachel Midura is a sixth-year history Ph.D. Candidate and senior graduate fellow at the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis at Stanford University. She is currently finishing her dissertation, “Masters of the Post: Northern Italy and the European Communications Network, 1530-1730” and an accompanying digital companion project, Early Modern Digital Itineraries (EmDigIt). In her research, she revisits traditional social, cultural and material historical approaches in order to incorporate twenty-first century understanding of media and social networks. Her work appears in the edited volumes Empires of Knowledge, Renaissance of Letters, and Print and Power. She is currently developing an article on EmDigIt for the Journal of Social History through the JSH/GMU Workshop for Articles on Digital History.

How does one recover history without traditional historical documentation? The Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project at Stanford turned to a variety of other source materials beyond text to develop an understanding of the lived experience of the workers. The Project collaborated with archaeologists to study what the gathered material culture of the workers could say about the quotidian conditions of labor camp life. We also explored mapping and other forms of digital based visualizations and close examination of historical photography. Without a robust data base, we had to be creative and draw from a variety of sources. We will discuss these issues and share examples of how digital technologies help us pres- ent our work. About the speakers: Shelley Fisher Fishkin is the Joseph S. Atha Professor of Humanities, Professor of English, and Director of American Studies at Stanford. She is Founding Editor of the Journal of Transnational American Studies, winner of the John Tuck-ey Award for Lifetime Achievement in Mark Twain Studies, and Co-Director of the Chinese Railroad Workers in North American Project at Stanford. Her most recent publications include Writing America: Literary Landmarks from Walden Pond to Wounded Knee, Zhi Lin: in Search of Chinese Migrants and the Transcontinental Railroad, and the first Chinese edition of Russell Conwell’s Why and How the Chinese Emigrate (1871). Gordon H. Chang is professor of history at Stanford University, the Olive H. Palmer of Professor in Humanities, and the Senior Associate Vice Provost for Undergrad- uate Education.

The Polygon in Spatial History,CESTA Seminar Series with Luca Scholz,"Deceptive Contiguity. The Polygon in Spatial History Abstract: The polygon is the most common vector data model used to represent political entities in spatial history and historical GIS. When it comes to visualizing the entangled, complex political geography of pre- modern societies, however, discrete, contiguous features can be a problematic cartographic choice. One example explored in this talk will be the aggressive enserfment of foreign peasants by a German prince in the seventeenth-century. The comparison of an older map of these events with digital maps based on new data shows how polygons can suggest the continuous distribution of phenomena that were really discontinuous. Indeed, in early modern political geography, the polygon often operates as the cartographic equivalent of problematic concepts such as absolutism and sovereignty. This talk will discuss the potential and limitations of different kinds of spatial data models and data available to early modern historians today. Bio: Luca Scholz is a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow and lecturer at Stanford University. He works on the history of early modern Europe, combining social, legal and intellectual history with geospatial and digital methods. Luca holds a PhD in History from the European University Institute, a joint MA in History from the École des hautes études en sciences sociales in Paris and the University of Heidelberg, as well as BA in Economics from the latter university. His first book, “The Enclosure of Movement. Borders and Mobility in the Holy Roman Empire”, is forthcoming with Oxford University Press. He has also published English, German, French, and Italian articles and chapters on passports, serfdom, the politics of protection, and spatial history. Beginning in Fall 2019 he will join the faculty of the University of Manchester (UK) as Lecturer in Digital Humanities.","Tue May 14th 2019, 12:00 - 1:00pm","Wallenberg Hall, Fourth Floor",CESTA Seminar Series (EVENT); Luca Scholz (PERSON); The Polygon in Spatial History CESTA Seminar Series (EVENT); Luca Scholz (PERSON); One (CARDINAL); German (NORP); the seventeenth-century (DATE); today (DATE); Luca Scholz (PERSON); Mellon (ORG); Stanford University (ORG); Europe (LOC); Luca (PERSON); PhD in History (WORK_OF_ART); the European University Institute (ORG); MA in History from the École des hautes études en sciences sociales (ORG); Paris (GPE); the University of Heidelberg (ORG); BA in Economics (ORG); first (ORDINAL); The Enclosure of Movement (WORK_OF_ART); Holy Roman Empire (GPE); Oxford University Press (ORG); English (LANGUAGE); German (LANGUAGE); French (LANGUAGE); Italian (NORP); Fall 2019 (DATE); the University of Manchester (ORG); UK (GPE); Digital Humanities (ORG),"Luca Scholz, Luca Scholz, Luca Scholz, Luca",Luca Scholz

These notes—and their interactions with each other—are notoriously hard to control: without years of close study, how can one know if a given melodic idea is rare or commonplace, a given rhythm mysterious or mundane? Our presentation introduces the Josquin Research Project (JRP, josquin.stanford.edu), a tool for exploring a central repertory of Renaissance music. We show what the project can do, how it is being used by a diverse constituency, and how humanities research of this kind can profitably change our engagement with large data sets. About the Researchers: Jesse Rodin , Director of the Josquin Research Project and Associate Professor of Music at Stanford, strives to make contact with lived musical experiences of the distant past. Rodin directs Cut Circle (cutcircle.org), a renowned vocal ensemble that brings Renaissance music close. A passionate teacher, he has led seminars, workshops, and masterclasses internationally. At Stanford he co-teaches “Food, Text, Music: A Multidisciplinary Lab on the Art of Feasting,” in which students explore historical sources, perform poetry and music, and cook medieval recipes. Rodin’s work has received wide recognition, including a recent fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation. Craig Stuart Sapp , Technical Director of the JRP, is Adjunct Professor of Music and a researcher at the Center for Computer Assisted Research in Humanities at Stanford University. He teaches classes in digital representations of music and computational music analysis (Music 253 & 254). Other digital music projects he is working on are the NEH-funded Tasso in Music Project (tassomusic.org), the Stanford Piano Roll Project, and a digital edition of Chopin’s music with the Fryderyk Chopin Institute in Warsaw, Poland. Christina Ding is a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and minoring in East Asian Studies. Christina is currently working on the JRP as an undergraduate research intern through CESTA. She has a background in music performance and composition. Since coming to Stanford she has been interested in studying the intersections between tech and music. On campus she is also involved in research within the CS department, as well as with student groups like the Stanford Symphony and Girls Teaching Girls to Code. Lunch will be served.

But making objects or events correspond to specific coordinates can overstate confidence in their locations, leading to disjointed or skewed results. This talk will propose one alternative to the point-mapping approach to spatial history by embracing a more fluid, path-based aesthetic. It describes this approach through a CESTA-supported digital humanities project, Tracing The Arctic Regions, which maps a pioneering photographic expedition of western Greenland led by the American artist William Bradford in 1869. Bio: George Philip LeBourdais, PhD, is the Consulting Curator for Digital Initiatives at CESTA. He received his doctorate in Art History from Stanford in 2018. His research, which has been supported by awards from the U.S. Fulbright Commission and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, explores how we represent things that defy description, like intense emotions, extreme environments and new technologies.

It is divided into two sections. First, the participants will be introduced to the historical context of late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Brazil and its Islamic communities, notably in its capital, Rio de Janeiro. The life of an Alufá known as tio [uncle] Sany will be a guiding trajectory to analyze migration phenomenon, anti-black legislation and community-building strategies among Muslim Africans in post-slavery Brazil. Secondly, in a practical manner, the audience will experiment with several digital repositories. Through guided exercises, the participants will use several resource websites to search and analyze manuscripts, printed materials and iconographic primary sources where the histories of tio Sany and other Alufás were documented. This way, through exposition and practical exercises, this workshop will discuss historiography, transnational diasporic contexts and digital methodologies. This is a hybrid event. Lunch will be provided for in person attendees. Please RSVP for lunch or to get the Zoom link. Information about the Speaker Bruno Véras is currently a sessional lecturer at the Department of Visual Studies and Department of English and Drama at the University of Toronto. He is a digital historian and cultural producer whose work focuses on public scholarship, memory, Global Africa, historical slavery, Diasporas and Art History. He has been developing multimedia digital humanities initiatives, and educational projects such as the Project Fragments of Memory: Artistic Representations of Diaspora Lives. Bruno Véras worked as a UNESCO consultant for African-Brazilian studies and museum exhibitions at FUNDAJ, Brazil (2014) and directed the awarded anti-racism art-educational projects in the Global South (2015).

Languages left behind are called endangered or technologically low-resourced (even though they may have millions of speakers). This collaborative and interdisciplinary digital humanities research project aims to help salvage those languages by combining computational linguistics, American Literature, and Translation Studies. Much as the Rosetta Stone helped decipher the demotic and hieroglyphic scripts thanks to the presence of the Greek translation, our project intends to preserve contemporary endangered languages and assist with their sur- vival through translation. Our project puts to use the extant translated versions of a single fictional text—Mark Twain’s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn —into a number of low-resourced languages spanning a period of nearly a century and a half. The project relies on the involvement of humans for data collection while natural language processing tools generate language resources (corpora, dictionaries, thesauri, lexicons) for those endangered languages. Ronald Jenn is a Professor at Université de Lille (France) where his research focuses on Translation and ideology, Digital Humanities, and Mark Twain. A recipient of a grant from the MESHS in Lille (2017-18) for the “Global Huck Project,” he is now involved in Roset- ta which looks at global translations of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn using digital tools. Amel Fraisse is an Associate Professor at Université de Lille (France) working on Digital Humanities and Natural Language Processing. Her research focuses on: Information Ex- traction, Knowledge Acquisition and Visualization from Texts, Multilingual information, and under-resourced languages. Zheng Zhang is a third year PhD student at Université Paris-Saclay (France). His research interests are graph-based word embeddings learning and par- allel sentence extraction from comparable corpora. Shelley Fisher Fishkin is the Joseph S. Atha Professor of Humanities, Professor of English, and Director of American Studies at Stanford.

Together biological and cultural memory create a sense of self that is stable yet always in flux. We exploit information technologies to elide the inevitable loss of human memory, in the process favoring some types of evidence over others. Digital memory appears to offer us a way around such limits. Image, sound, text, and data—all can be represented by digital code. Rumsey will discuss the responsibilities of the humanities to appraise the nature of digital code as a trustworthy medium to secure the integrity, authenticity, and accessibility of the memories that shape our collective identities. Bio: Abby Smith Rumsey is a writer and historian focusing on the creation, preservation, and use of the cultural record in all media. She has written and lectured widely on digital preservation, online scholarship, the nature of evidence, the changing roles of libraries and archives, intellectual property policies in the digital age, and the impact of new information technologies on perceptions of history and time. She served as director of the Scholarly Communication Institute at the University of Virginia, and has advised universities and their research libraries on strategies to integrate digital information resources into existing collections and services.

In studying the centuries before #MeToo, historians have little access to women’s personal narratives of sexual violence beyond legal cases, which represent only the small percent of assaults reported and prosecuted. What might the thousands of women’s oral history narratives conducted since the 1970s and digitized in the past decade reveal? OHTAP has collected approximately 1,000 digitized transcripts from many institutional collections. We are now developing methods to organize, analyze, and interpret these transcripts and the associated metadata. This heterogeneous dataset allows us to explore how women from diverse social groups and cohorts named and remembered sexual violence, the ways institutions responded to assault and harassment, and how patterns changed over time. Our larger goal is to establish methodologies for digital analysis of oral history interviews that can be applied widely by historians and other scholars. The Project Team: The Edgar E. Robinson Professor in U.S. History at Stanford University, Estelle Freedman co-founded the Stanford Program in Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. She is the author or editor of ten books, including No Turning Back: The History of Feminism and the Future of Women (2002), Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America (with John D’Emilio; 3d ed. 2012), and Redefining Rape: Sexual Violence in the Era of Suffrage and Segregation (2013).

Dr. Bridget Whearty will present: From Scribes to ScanOps: 600 Years of Copying Hoccleve Abstract: Digitized medieval manuscripts are curiously depopulated things. Although large teams of workers create each one, evidence of those workers is generally erased from the final product. But this standard practice today goes against centuries of earlier bookmaking, which emphatically foregrounded the physical and mental labor of books’ intervening copyists. This talk traces the transmission of the works of Thomas Hoccleve, fifteenth-century poet and professional scribe—through fifteenth-century manuscripts to twenty-first century digitizations to show where and how scribal erasure became the norm today. Ultimately, I argue that recovering pre-twentieth-century bookmaking values can redress problematic labor practices today and help us achieve a more just digital future. About the speaker: Bridget Whearty is an Assistant Professor in the Department of English Literature and the Medieval Studies Program at Binghamton University. Prior to this, she was a Council on Libraries and Information Resources (CLIR) Postdoctoral Fellow in Data Curation for Medieval Studies at Stanford University where she worked in the Digital Library Systems and Services department of Stanford University Libraries (2013-2015).

Dr. Michael Penn will present: The Automated Scribal Identification Project: Digital Paleography and the History of Eastern Christianity Abstract: What happens when you put in the same room a professor of religious studies, a computer scientist, and an engineering major in search of a senior thesis? Then let that incubate a few years and add a professor of visual analytics, four consultants, and 29 research assistants. In this case, the result is a digital paleography project using ancient Aramaic manuscripts as a case study for exploring how recent advances in the digital analysis of handwriting can help scholars better ascertain a manuscript’s provenance, identify manuscripts written by the same scribe, and trace the chronological development of ancient scripts. Join Professor Penn to discuss this unlikely combination, its outcomes, and the larger issue of applying modern technology to pre-modern history. About the speaker: Michael Penn is the Teresa Hihn Moore Professor of Religious Studies. A specialist in the history of early Christianity, Professor Penn’s research focuses on middle eastern Christians who wrote in the Aramaic dialect of Syriac. His books include: Kissing Christians, Envisioning Islam, and When Christians First Met Muslims. For these projects Professor Penn has received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the ACLS, the NEH, the National Humanities Center, the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, the APA, and the British Academy. Before joining Stanford, Professor Penn was for fifteen years on the faculty of Mount Holyoke College. He has also taught at Brandeis University, Haverford College, Bryn Mawr College, and Duke University.

Dr. Dan Jurafsky will present on: Automatically Extracting Social Meaning from Language Abstract: In this talk, Dr. Jurafsky describes research from his lab on computationally extracting social meaning from language, meaning that takes into account social relationships between people. He studies interactions between police and community members in traffic stops recorded in body-worn camera footage, using language to measure interaction quality, study the role of race, and draw suggestions for going forward in this fraught area. He then show how understanding of framing and socio-economic variables can be extracted from the language of food: menus, reviews, and advertising. He also discusses computational methods for studying how meaning changes over time and how these changes can be used to study historical societal biases and cultural preconceptions. Together, these studies highlight how computational methods can help us interpret some of the latent social content behind the words we use. About the speaker: Dan Jurafsky is the Jackson Eli Reynolds Professor in Humanities, Professor and Chair of Linguistics and Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University. His research focuses on the extraction of meaning, intention, and affect from text and speech, on the processing of Chinese, and on applying natural language processing to the cognitive and social sciences. Dan is passionate about NLP education; he is the co-author of the widely-used textbook ""Speech and Language Processing"" and co-taught the first massive open online class on natural language processing.

The Senegal Liberations Project will present their new paper focusing on runaway enslaved families: Despite significant risks; enslaved people have always had recourse to desertion. Running away was an act of resistance. It often meant leaving behind subsistence, security, and a sense of belonging. It also opened up enslaved persons to the consequences of potential recapture, violence, and material deprivation.  Women’s gendered vulnerabilities exacerbated these risks, especially when they had children. In Senegambia, enslaved women never held legal custody of their own children, who belonged to the mother’s owner, no matter the father’s identity. Enslaved women, thus, frequently ran away not only to gain their freedom, but to maintain guardianship of their children. Between 1857 and 1903, nearly 29,000 enslaved men, women, and children requested formal “certificates of liberation” from French colonial authorities. In our preliminary analysis, we have identified just over 1,400 runaway families in the registers. Mothers, not fathers, appear most regularly as children’s guardians. This pattern points to significant, strategic, and gendered acts of resistance.  Our paper probes the gendered demographics of runaway families, examining changes over time and families’ compositions to recover patterns of everyday resistance to slavery and portray the dynamics of enslaved family formation in Senegambia.","Tue May 14th 2024, 5:00 - 6:30pm","Wallenberg Hall, Room 433A","Runaway Enslaved Families in Senegal: Mothers, Children (WORK_OF_ART); 1857-1903 (DATE); Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis CESTA (WORK_OF_ART); the Freedom and Slavery Workshop (WORK_OF_ART); the ""Senegalese Slave Liberations Project"" (EVENT); Runaway Enslaved Families in Senegal: Mothers, Children (WORK_OF_ART); 1857-1903 (DATE); CESTA (ORG); the Freedom and Slavery Workshop (EVENT); the ""Senegalese Slave Liberations Project"" (EVENT); Richard Roberts (PERSON); Stanford History Department (ORG); Wallace Stevens (PERSON); Stanford PhD Candidate (ORG); Becca De Los Santos (PERSON); Stanford Undergraduate Student (ORG); Senegalese (NORP); 1857 (DATE); 1903 (DATE); RSVP (ORG); Zoom (PRODUCT); The Senegal Liberations Project (ORG); Senegambia (NORP); Between 1857 and 1903 (DATE); nearly 29,000 (CARDINAL); French (NORP); just over 1,400 (CARDINAL); Senegambia (GPE)","Richard Roberts, Wallace Stevens, Becca De Los Santos","Becca De Los Santos, Wallace Stevens, Richard Roberts"

Throughout the presentation of some practical cases of forensic anthropology, we aim to highlight what we consider fundamental steps in a forensic anthropology exam which importance has been receiving increasing recognition not only from other forensic practitioners but also from the general public. Previous procedures such as maceration, cleaning, gathering samples, imagiological exams are of paramount importance. State of preservation and conservation will dictate not only the techniques to be applied but also the experts present at the expertise. Complicity with the forensic pathologist is therefore crucial. In what concerns identification we will briefly discuss the methods used to assess the biological profile, and detaching what we consider fundamental in search of identity factors where every little detail is outstanding. For the interpretation of the language of fractures, the role of a forensic anthropologist is unique, but he or she should not talk about cause and manner of death all alone since this is an attribution of the forensic pathologist. We will bring a general overview of forensic anthropology in Europe where the reality is not homogeneous and where the background of the experts and the type of cases can vary in function of social problems, such as migration, from country to country. The situation will generally be compared with the one in the US.

It's Statistics.,"""It's Not a Scandal. It's Statistics""  Public keynote address by Dr. Lyle W. Konisgberg (Department of Anthropology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) The title of this talk is a quote from Christine Romans, host of CNN Money. The title harkens back to a discussion the evening of June 9, 1999 after the first day of the first Rostock Work-shop on “Mathematical Modelling for Paleodemography: Coming to Consensus.” At dinner one observer of the workshop referred to the day’s proceedings as “statistical smoke and mirrors.” They then stated that one simply needed to count the number of cementum annuli, add the average age of eruption, and one would know the age to within a year or two. This statement was made prior to the numerous advances that have been made in “cementochronology.” However, even with these recent developments, we are often faced with making age estimations in both the living and the dead that rely on general bone and/or dental development or senescence. This is necessarily a statistical endeavor. The goal is to model development or senescence as a function of age and then “invert” the problem using Bayes’ Theorem. For single traits, this is not a difficult endeavor, but the analysis becomes more complicated when there are multiple traits and particularly when the traits are a mix of binary, ordinal categorical, and continuous variables. It is expected that traits will not be conditionally independent. In other words, there are generally non-zero residual correlations between traits after conditioning on age. Although there have been ad hoc solutions to this problem, the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods allows researchers to esti-mate the residual correlations without recourse to multivariate numerical integration. Ko-nigsberg and Herrmann suggested the use of MCMC methods at the first Rostock Work-shop. These methods have begun to receive greater acceptance and have been applied in paleodemography and in age estimation. MCMC comes with the additional benefit that one can produce posterior predictive distributions of the traits as a check on whether the refer-ence and target samples age in the same fashion.

Professor Henriot's topic will be: ""Mining the Asia Directory & Chronicle: A New Exploration of the Foreign Presence in Asia (1863-1934)."" Abstract: The history of foreign presence in Asia has been examined from various vantage points (imperial studies, colonial studies, etc.), most often with a focus on a single country or through the onslaught of maritime trade or military conquest. This talk will offer a different perspective and approach. It is part of an on-going and ambitious project to explore a unique source ­--   The Asia Chronicle and Directory , a multi-year and multi-volume collection ­--  through the integration of new technologies, which are enabling development of a comprehensive digital resource for the research community rather than simply a digital version of the printed volumes. Because these volumes cover the entire East Asia and Southeast Asia region, they offer an unprecedented source of information at the level of individual actors, both individuals and institutions, with verified instances of hundreds of thousands of persons, employment, corporations, products and locations, as well as events, maps and published notices including advertisements. The presentation will explore the methodological challenges of the digital transformation of the Asia Chronicle and Directory and present preliminary research results based on the rich processed data.

Topics covered will be painting, murals, street art, music, and Latino cinema as the chief art forms that define border culture and expression. In addition, the program will explore the recent “Pacific Standard Time” (PST) art exhibitions, funded by the Getty Foundation, as the largest collaborative effort ever mounted by arts institutions on the Southwestern border about Latino art, history and heritage. Professor Chagoya will speak about his socio-political paintings that depict matters of war, border and immigration, religious and cultural differences, global politics, and the plight of migrants as meso-american symbols of invasion, suffering, and the blurring of borders. Professor Indych-López will speak on her recently released scholarly monograph on Chicana public artist and muralist Judith F. Baca, as well as other Latina/o art production that contends with border culture, transnational diversity, immigration and dislocation, historical ruptures, and the visual construction of racial, ethnic, gender, and class identities. Professor Madrid will speak about the trans-border musical traditions that blend classical, popular, and folk music nationalism that transcends place, history, geography, politics, and the intersection of globalization, ethnic identity and border culture. Professor Noriega will speak about Chicano cinema as a lens for understanding media and culture, sociology and mass communications, and ethnicity and gender that merge art with populist politics in film. He will also discuss his leading role in curating LACMA’s recent groundbreaking art exhibition, Home- So Different, So Appealing (2017-18), that showed over 100 works exploring the themes of immigration and political repression, dislocation and diaspora, and personal memory and utopian ideals found in Latino art.

This workshop begins the hard task of unpacking this late nineteenth-century nexus, challenging in particular its data legacies. What conditions underwrote these codifications of race, gender, and development? What do they tell us about the prehistory of data in the centuries before, and what are the consequences of that transformation today? Erik Fredner's and Jo Guldi's work in the digital humanities deconstructs the conditions of possibility for, and future ramifications of, this nineteenth-century turn towards data, while aiding the recovery of alternate forms of information design that may help us realize the multi-valent possibilities of data outside of its original narrow historical channels.

Mapping changes in the distribution of the ants shows how the Argentine ant population is supported by water from nearby gardens and houses at the edge of the Preserve, and how a native ant species has been able to resist the invasive Argentine ant during times of drought. 3) A 5-year survey of the spatial distribution of fungal spores on the Stanford campus, made as part of Gordon’s ""Ecology for Everyone"" course. Students sample fungal spores from the air in their dorm rooms, and we examine how species richness and abundance varies among buildings and across seasons. 4) A digital storytelling platform, LandTalk ( www.landtalk.org ), collates student-led interviews of older persons who have been long-term observers of landscape change.

This paper considers how naturalists aspired to study global nature from 1500 to 1900. During this period, Europeans sought to write a global natural history that categorized the plants and animals they encountered into one unified system of collection and classification. Non-Europeans, such as Ottomans and Mexica, however, had different stories to tell about their own quest in nature. Encounters between European and non-Europeans led these naturalists to cast aside their individual subjecthood while expanding—and challenging—their own perceptions of nature. Using digital tools, this paper proposes new approaches to restoring the centrality of local knowledge to insights abstracted from it. The paper considers geography, networks, and language as lenses through which to both grapple with the globality of this enterprise of knowledge creation and to consider nature studies within and beyond published natural histories. In particular, it seeks to understand how quests for universal knowledge overlapped among different knowledge cultures.

His research centers on how politics and political institutions affect economic outcomes. Along with his dissertation, his projects address the following questions: How does politics shape market structures? Why do contract-intensive markets develop without strong political institutions? Do political relations between nations still affect their economic ties in a globalized world? If so, when and how? Addressing these questions, he uses mixed methods, drawing extensively from fieldwork, archival materials, geospatial data, as well as experimental data. His primary geographical area of interest is China. Anna Lunn is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Sociology, Stanford University and a current Digital Humanities-Asia Fellow. Anna examines the intersection of development goals and private lives to understand how health and development emerge on the ground.

Our topic will be the relationship between Literary Studies and the Digital Humanities, specifically that associated with text mining or quantitative analysis. In what ways have we been successful in integrating the two fields to produce new methodologies for studying Literary Criticism and History? Where do the fault lines between the fields still exist and what work might be necessary to synthesize the methodologies of close reading and computation? And are there fundamental incompatibilities between the humanistic study of literature and the Digital Humanities that we may not be able to solve? With four very different perspectives, our roundtable participants will lay out the stakes of this compatibility and engage the audience in a larger conversation about the future(s) of the field.","Fri January 26th 2018, 5:15pm","Terrace Room of the Department of English (Margaret Jacks Hall, 4th floor)","Friday, January 26 (DATE); 5:15 – 7:00 (TIME); the Terrace Room (FAC); the Department of English (ORG); Margaret Jacks Hall (FAC); 4th (ORDINAL); the Literary Lab (ORG); Amy Hungerford (PERSON); Jonathan Kramnick (PERSON); Yale University (ORG); Hannah Walser (PERSON); the Harvard Society of Fellows (ORG); Mark Algee-Hewitt (PERSON); the Stanford Literary Lab (ORG); Fri day, January 26 (DATE); 5:15 – 7:00 (TIME); the Terrace Room (FAC); the Department of English (ORG); Margaret Jacks Hall (FAC); 4th (ORDINAL); the Literary Lab (ORG); Amy Hungerford (PERSON); Jonathan Kramnick (PERSON); Yale University (ORG); Hannah Walser (PERSON); the Harvard Society of Fellows (ORG); Mark Algee- Hewitt (PERSON); the Stanford Literary Lab (ORG); the Digital Humanities (ORG); two (CARDINAL); four (CARDINAL)","Amy Hungerford, Jonathan Kramnick, Hannah Walser, Mark Algee-Hewitt, Amy Hungerford, Jonathan Kramnick, Hannah Walser, Mark Algee- Hewitt","Mark Algee-Hewitt, Hannah Walser, Mark Algee- Hewitt, Jonathan Kramnick, Amy Hungerford"

As a freshman at A&T College, Greensboro, he participated in the student movement that desegregated Woolworth's and other “white only” institutions throughout the South. While a student of Comparative Literature at Columbia University, he met and was influenced by poet and activist LeRoi Jones (later Baraka) and the Black Arts Movement. After receiving his M.A. from the University of Chicago, Brown published his first novel, The Life and Loves of Mr. Jiveass Nigger (Farrar, Straus, & Giroux, 1969). In 1970, Brown began teaching in the English Department at UC Berkeley. After meeing Richard Pryor there in 1972, Brown moved to Hollywood to work with Pryor on his film, Which Way Is Up?, which Mr. Brown co-wrote. He later published a novel, Days Without Weather (1983), about this experience.

1716323825-357.html,The Matter of Medieval Manuscripts | Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis,,The Matter of Medieval Manuscripts," Tens of thousands of manuscripts survive from the western medieval period, circa 500–1500. Each of these manuscripts is uniquely handwritten and decorated—a product of immense expertise and often immense expense. All genres of writing survive, from laws and medical works, famous and not-so-famous literary texts, glorious illuminated bibles and psalters, to the workaday notebooks of students. Medieval books were prized and venerated, sold and traded, and sometimes even held hostage. They contained religious and irreligious words and images in startling juxtaposition; and they now have a global following through their frequent use in historical documentaries, in science fiction and fantasy, and on social media. In this lecture, Elaine Treharne will explore how contemporary audiences get access to and use these manuscripts, both in the real world and in the virtual world. These users include scholars, of course, but also (regrettably) those who destroy medieval manuscripts for financial gain, those who show off their collections with little idea of what they mean, and even those who try to recreate libraries and volumes that never existed (that’s the science fiction and fantasy).  More about Elaine Treharne, Roberta Bowman Denning Professor of Humanities; Professor of English, Stanford: Elaine Treharne is a world-renowned scholar of medieval manuscripts and English texts, and more broadly of the history of the book. She has published twenty-eight books and over sixty articles focusing on literature and its contexts from 500 through 1600 CE. Her next book, The Phenomenal Book , is due out in 2018; and the fourth edition of her Blackwell Anthology of Old and Middle English Literature will be published the same year. She is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, of the English Association, and of the Royal Historical Society. She also directs Stanford’s Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis and Stanford Text Technologies.","Wed November 29th 2017, 7:30pm","Bishop Auditorium, Lathrop Library",Tens of thousands (CARDINAL); 500 (CARDINAL); 1500 (CARDINAL); Elaine Treharne (PERSON); Elaine Treharne (PERSON); Roberta Bowman Denning (PERSON); English (LANGUAGE); Stanford (ORG); Elaine Treharne (PERSON); English (LANGUAGE); twenty-eight (CARDINAL); sixty (CARDINAL); 500 (CARDINAL); The Phenomenal Book (WORK_OF_ART); 2018 (DATE); fourth (ORDINAL); Blackwell Anthology of Old and Middle English Literature (WORK_OF_ART); the same year (DATE); the Society of Antiquaries (ORG); the English Association (ORG); the Royal Historical Society (ORG); Stanford’s Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (ORG); Stanford Text Technologies (ORG),"Elaine Treharne, Elaine Treharne, Roberta Bowman Denning, Elaine Treharne","Elaine Treharne, Roberta Bowman Denning"

In a similar vein, Richard Jean So argues that many distant reading projects describe rather than model their corpus, thereby missing out on the possibilities for more nuanced analysis. Bode and So thus both highlight the importance of understanding and making explicit the interpretive nature of data collection and analysis.

At this pivotal moment in digital medieval studies, the panel assesses progress, boundaries, and setbacks, with particular attention to the field’s self-identified exceptionalism, potentials for collaboration, and the effects of mainstreaming. Attendees are encouraged – but not required – to review Speculum ’s DH issue in advance of the seminar, and to prepare to engage in the following: how has medieval studies approached digital humanities in either unique or conventional ways? Do its approaches differ from other fields? How is medieval studies uniquely qualified (or not qualified) to utilize digital humanities methodologies? What aspects of our approach could be improved or refined, and what new directions would be most effective in the future? Should we value originality over building precedent? We particularly welcome perspectives from non-medievalists in the Stanford community as we assess ways forward. Please find the articles here: http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/toc/spc/2017/92/S1 .

Fleming's recent article in New Literary History 48.3 on distant and exemplary readings. Mark Algee-Hewitt is Assistant Professor of English at Stanford University. His research focuses on the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in England and Germany and seeks to combine literary criticism with digital and quantitative analyses of literary texts. He has particular interests in the history of aesthetic theory, the development and transmission of aesthetic and philosophic concepts during the Enlightenment and Romantic periods, and the relationship between aesthetic theory and poetry. Steele Douris is currently a Ph.D. Candidate in English at Stanford University. She graduated with a B.A from the University of Texas, Austin in 2013. Her current research focuses on nineteenth-century British literature and Digital Humanities. J.D. Porter is a Ph.D. Candidate in English at Stanford University. His dissertation explains the relationship between social fictions (ideas that once seemed natural and uncontroversial, but today are understood as constructions) and American modernist literary form. He examines what four social fictions—race, money, gender, and nation— can tell us about modernism, and what the explorations of the modernists can tell us about our interactions with these social forms today.

I find that these responses show an attitude of skepticism and reservation—distrust rather than trust—in the autocrats’ information, even though, superficially, it sounds helpful and reassuring. Distrust is indicated not only through opinion but, more convincingly, in residents’ behavior of avoiding the railway station even as autocrats and Party functionaries repeated their reassuring stories. My study, which is based on a unique dataset from social media and geo-tagged smartphones, shows happenings immediately before and after the attack – that is, in real time rather than retroactively, as it would be were I to use standard survey-and-interview techniques. Theoretically, I postulate that in authoritarian societies, people are likely to distrust autocrats’ information when it is loud and univocal, even in a crisis when, in the midst of uncertainty and impending chaos, a clear and authoritative voice might seem called for. ABOUT THE SPEAKER Charles Chang is the Postdoctoral Fellow in Chinese Studies at Stanford University. Before Stanford, he has earned his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2016. His research focuses on the political communication in contemporary China. With the rise of the internet, smartphones, and social media, social science is becoming increasingly computational and often involves the collection and analysis of massive data.  This computational trend is reflected in his dissertation.  For him, one purpose of such an approach is to understand how Chinese internet users, who number more than 700 million, respond to an unprecedented political event, namely, the most recent anticorruption campaign. His analysis follows two paths.  One path makes possible the identification of urban land use at a community level.  Mapping the distribution of netizens onto different communities allows him to gain more precise knowledge of their social status, means of communication, and social behavior.  A second analytical path complements the first and takes us further into precise knowledge by graphing, following each official news announcement, human interaction at a micro-spatial granularity as well as temporality, from day to day and even moment to moment.  His novel approach uses massive social-media data.  He intends to apply to other socio-political issues in his dissertation book.  Its merit lies in that it offers a departure from and a check on the more common sampling, ""snapshot"" approach in the social sciences.","Thu May 11th 2017, 12:00 - 1:30pm",CESTA (4th floor of Wallenberg Hall),DHAsia Presents | Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (WORK_OF_ART); Kunming (GPE); China (GPE); 2014 (DATE); China's Era of “Big Data” | DHAsia Presents (WORK_OF_ART); Kunming (GPE); China (GPE); 2014 (DATE); Party (ORG); Charles Chang (PERSON); Chinese (NORP); Stanford University (ORG); Stanford (ORG); Ph.D. (WORK_OF_ART); the University of Wisconsin-Madison (ORG); 2016 (DATE); China (GPE); one (CARDINAL); Chinese (NORP); more than 700 million (CARDINAL); two (CARDINAL); One (CARDINAL); second (ORDINAL); first (ORDINAL),Charles Chang,Charles Chang

Did these new economic and cultural conditions inspire new forms of government? Did they change the composition and behavior of the political elite? Relying both on data from the China Biographical Database (CBDB) and those collected through direct research, this lecture will explore the geographic origins of Song civil officials, patterns of their bureaucratic assignments, and their kinship networks. It will show that over the course of the Song period, proximity to the capital as a catalyst to political success was supplanted by residence in more diverse zones of economic prosperity and high educational investment. It will also demonstrate that the practice of giving civil officials assignments all over the empire gave way to a preference for employing officials close to their homes. In the midst of these changes, the political elite transformed from a capital-centered group into one which maintained ever closer connections to their native communities. This talk illustrates how a wide range of digital tools may be combined and lead to new findings in historical inquiry.","Tue May 9th 2017, 4:15 - 6:00pm","CESTA, Wallenberg Hall, 4th Floor",Chinese (NORP); Chinese (NORP); Chinese (NORP); Song Chen (PERSON); Chinese (NORP); the China Biographical Database (ORG); CBDB (ORG),Song Chen,Song Chen

By identifying significant collocates of key racial and ethnic terms at particular historical moments, we are able to reconstruct the semantic system that gave racial concepts narrative meaning. In this presentation, we will focus on two notable outcomes of our research. First, we show that collocate analysis enables us to assess the ""stickiness"" of any given ethnic identity: that is, how much did the American understanding of an ethnic category change over time? Second, we use our findings to gesture toward a quantitative analysis of linguistic patterns associated with stereotyping, and suggest directions for further research on the subject. J.D. Porter is a Ph.D. Candidate in English at Stanford University. His dissertation explains the relationship between social fictions (ideas that once seemed natural and uncontroversial, but today are understood as constructions) and American modernist literary form. He examines what four social fictions—race, money, gender, and nation— can tell us about modernism, and what the explorations of the modernists can tell us about our interactions with these social forms today. Hannah Walser earned her Ph.D. from the Department of English at Stanford in 2016 with a dissertation on nineteenth-century American fiction. Her research is located at the intersection of literature and cognitive science, with a particular focus on fiction's role in developing new and non-normative models of the mind.

In later works, a related but distinct type of text reuse appears: intentional but unattributed allusion to the contents of earlier influential or well-known works. Identifying concrete instances of both types of reuse can assist in the interpretation of obscure or disputed passages, and for early texts in particular can also shed light upon difficult issues of authorship and textual history. Digital methods not only offer the prospect of locating individual instances of both types of reuse automatically, but to the extent to which they can reliably do so also make possible the systematic study of text reuse across a corpus of works as a whole. I describe methods of identifying concrete instances of text reuse in the classical Chinese corpus, evaluate the degrees of accuracy achieved, and demonstrate how the data produced allow text reuse patterns to be explored at a corpus level.

Many of them are beautiful, quite a lot are strange, some are both. To complement and enrich the visual information available in Kindred London ’s four historical maps and to furnish a further dimension to our evocation of the city, we opted not for the obvious choice of matching period pictures but instead for a juxtaposition of past cartography and present photography. This talk discusses the process of collecting for use in our mapping project an archive of contemporary CC-licensed images of every part of the British capital made by multiple amateur photographers. Among the questions I’ll consider are: What uses can scholarship make of disparate materials originally created without any co-ordinated or central purpose? What can we learn about London by trawling through Flickr? What can we learn about Flickr by focusing on London? And, finally, can there be a “poetic” side to a DH project?

This has seen the recent emergence of Buddhist and Daoist Medicine as new fields of historical inquiry, which challenge the habitual borders between earlier histories of religion and medicine. As historians have begun to draw on long-known insights in anthropology, that therapeutic and salvific aims frequently converge in practice, they have begun to open up new research directions into the admixture of “medical” practices such as drugs, needles and moxibustion with “religious” practices such as incantation, spells and rituals. Currently there is no systematic way to get an overview for how therapies are distributed through the canons, the communities who wrote these texts, or their distribution across historical time and space. New catalogues continue to be published, but their categories limit the aims of researchers, whose goals constantly shift as new theoretical insights and typologies of practice come into their view. The platform developed by Dept. III of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science and National Taiwan University’s Research Centre for Digital Humanities allows scholars to define their own repertoires of practice or sets of materials as term lists. The subject for the initial pilot study examines drug knowledge throughout the corpus of Six Dynasties Buddhist and Daoist texts. They can then search for these across large corpuses of data, and discover their relative distribution across bibliographic and sectarian genres, as well as time and space, where known. Researchers can then markup significant texts for more detailed analysis. The platform can then perform detailed analysis of these small text segments. By combining large-scale analytical tools and a full-text database in the same platform, this tool enables researchers to easily switch between close and distant reading modes. This pilot research compares the uses of drugs, their geographic distribution, whether certain sects possess certain drug knowledge, whether it circulates and if so how, and under what circumstances. Results at the time of writing are preliminary, but suggest that early Vināya translations reveal five different regional drug traditions from North India.

Their installation was inspired by Marcus Vitruvius Pollio’s first century BC treatise on architecture, De architectura libri decem , in which he discusses the placement of bronze vases in amphitheaters whose intended function was to strengthen the voices of the performers. The acoustic vase is the only direct proof that pre-modern musicians, architects and their patrons were actively engaged in the manipulation of the acoustical environment. The most unusual—yet largely unknown—installation of acoustic vases in Western Europe is found in the Cathedral of Noyon, the so-called caveau phonocamptique , a chamber installed beneath the pavement of the crossing. The caveau , which probably dates from the sixteenth century, seems to have been intended as a monumental amplifier. The vocal production of a cleric or group of singers situated at a lectern directly beneath the crossing would have entered the chamber through an aperture in the floor, have been reinforced by the array of vases, then returned to the space by the same route. Paradoxically, the effect of an acoustic vase can only be one of absorption, according to the principle of conservation of energy. Yet a vase, when sung directly into, appears to “sing back” to its beholder. This effect, and the importance of Vitruvius as the foremost authority on ancient architecture known to European builders and patrons, must ultimately account for this unique—and improbable—installation at Noyon.

Showing that flows and discourse transformations of IDB and UNESCO have promoted a shift in cultural heritage management based not on the nation-state but on global relations and economic development of cultural heritage, this study brings important insights on how development projects, using identities and memories, may have introduced the idea of the commodification of the past.

This includes display of oral history interviews and archival records, and making their  content more amenable to searches. Science archives wrestle with the  challenge of not just putting out the data, but of building spaces  where historians, journalists, the scientific community and the  general public can see stories emerging from the linking of seemingly  disparate records.Through this work in progress, this project offers the conceptual framework for an online public history exhibit that builds multiple narratives from raw archival data. Such a digital exhibit allows us to pulls material from a variety of primary and secondary sources into coherent stories, and connect personal stories to established records of a scientific process.The National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) digital is a pilot project built around thirteen ways to reflect upon and assemble the history of the Bangalore-based institution (the exhibit title pays homage to Wallace Stevens' poem, Thirteen Ways of Looking  at a Blackbird).  The exhibit tries to bring to light multiple interpretations of the NCBS, weaved by the voices of over 70 story tellers. The material for the  exhibit is curated from records collected to build the Centre's  archive. The oral history excerpts, along with over 600 photographs, official records, letters, and the occasional lab note, give a glimpse into the Centre's history and show connections with the present.The exhibit is the first phase of a digital experiment in journalism and story telling, centered around archival materials.Venkat Srinivasan is a visiting researcher at the National Centre for  Biological Sciences in Bangalore, India ( https://www.ncbs.res.in/ ).

The snacks ( xiao chi 小吃) that are sold from the small shops and mobile stands of the city’s streets and alleyways - dumplings steamed in wooden baskets, nighttime barbeques, carts selling stir-fried noodles - are all disappearing. Shanghai’s officials and urban planners seem to subscribe to the dominant modernist narrative, which contends that development demands that the informality of street vending be replaced by the regulated order of chain stores and shopping malls. In Shanghai progress is often equated with ‘cleaning up the streets’. This talk aims to challenges this view, arguing that street food, street markets, street culture and street life are an integral part of the liveliness and livability of the 21st century city. It does so by presenting an ongoing project in the digital humanities that uses deep mapping and digital storytelling to investigate Shanghai’s shifting street food landscape and transforming culinary neighborhoods. During her residency at Stanford, Professor Greenspan will also lead a registration-required, hands-on DHAsia workshop. The registration link can be found here .

Early twentieth-century connoisseurs and scholars who first looked at objects from the African continent as art sought to delineate such discrete styles. The approach is grounded in an assumption that art style coincides with language, religion, social organization, and geography. Yet scholars have for decades recognized that art style, language, religion, social organization, and geography do not overlap so neatly. Nevertheless, the classifications and assumptions undergirding them endure in museums, exhibitions, and publications.

Sobti","The critical biographies of borderlands —the conditions created by borders, boundaries and abandoned terrains—are evocative biographies of ‘no places’ and the people who no longer live there. Yet, these biographies are seldom recorded even though the passage of history through these so-called spatial ‘edges’ frequently leaves behind a rich palimpsest of cultural process. This research re-imagines medieval landscapes and spatialities along one such unique borderland condition on the legendary Silk Road, located on Central Asia’s legendary Oxus River (later the Amu Darya). Within the context of the decisive, Arab invasions on Central Asia between 675-750 CE, this waterway served as the selectively permeable, border/boundary condition for the Arab armies moving across the cultural region of Khorasan. The Oxus was forded at only two crossing points along its length, both of which have retained this significant role through time. In moving beyond empirical narratives and quantitative potomology, this work reconstructs this spectacular riverine landscape and its two crossing points, based on collections of topographical, Soviet-era de-classified maps, and by employing imaginative technologies that describe the ‘places of choreographies’ mentioned in the archival sources. It collates ‘landscape stories’ from a plethora of historical sources ranging from archival maps, textual and biographical accounts, to archeological and hydraulic reports. It thereby lends unprecedented ‘voice’ to the river’s tumultuous history and to the seemingly ‘inconsequential’ cultural landscape on her banks, while exploring how cultural indigeneity was transmitted with the human migrations across this geographical liminality, creating cities and architecture.

It has been argued by (Turkel 2011: 287) that “digitization creates a representation that shares some of the attributes of an original and that even technologies that are not frequently used by historians may enable the capture and recreation of documents, artefacts, and environments.” Taking into consideration that historians are today more frequently encouraged to think in terms of digital transduction of historical materials, this presentation focuses on current trends in visualizing history. More precisely, Dr. Foka will focus on the visualization of the past as 1) interactive mapping applications and 2) immersive, virtual reality environments. For the purpose of this talk she will discuss projects that are recently, digitally implemented at Umeå University. She will analyze their role as knowledge production processes as well as artefacts for outreach engagement. She will show how both our historical knowledge is fragmented and how digital technology may equally appear ‘broken’ in reassembling data and communicating the past.  Ultimately, Dr. Foka argues that on many accounts, historical studies qua digital is still conceptual and experimental, but it is, nevertheless a worthy enterprise. Anna Foka is associate professor  in Information Technology and the Humanities at HUMlab , Umeå University , in Sweden, and has a background in social and cultural history and classical philology.

American visual culture tends to treat the subtitle as a “pariah” in the imperial territory of the visual regime: it is not only suppressed at the peripheral zones of the screen since it was invented, mainly at the bottom, but also minimalized to ensure the spectator’s immersion in cinematic space and time. In contrast, Chinese media culture has manifested a love of the hated subtitle since the transition to digital media in the 2000s, featuring both the excessive use of titles and the subtitle’s intrusion into the center of visual space. This paper focuses on two exemplary instances of title-overflowing:1) the “magic title” in reality TV shows which was attached haphazardly to the surface of the represented three-dimensional space. Its flat cartoonish form was used to exaggerate nonverbal sounds, signify inner thoughts and emotions and point to the accidental, easily ignored but more interesting details in the image, through the use of a prosthetic pointing hand. 2) Danmu (弹幕, or Danmaku in Japanese), the titling system of online video-sharing websites （i.e. Bilibili and AcFun） which allows previously obscured subtitles along with off-screen comments to not only intrude into the central visual choreography, but also overlie and even fully obscure the visual images. Although magic title ensconces itself in television while Danmu is more commonly used in online entertainment, current Chinese media culture witnesses an intermediary chiasm of these two over-titling practices.   By conducting a neo-formalist study of the over-titled (moving-) images, this paper argues that the heterogeneous over-titling practices in Chinese media culture question the default visual hierarchies and aesthetic prioritization which are secretly shaped by dominant Western visual paradigm and demonstrate alternative possibilities in the relationship of image and text. The unique form of over-titled (moving-)images calls our attention to computational process whose traces are often erased or concealed to maintain a continuity between analogical and digital media – “business as usual” as Thomas Elsaesser claims. Considering post-production which produces magic titles and real-time interactive system which enables danmu, this paper argues, on one hand, that the new power of digital media could derive from its manipulability and susceptibility --the qualities oft-deprecated for its threats to photographic creditability, the recalcitrant norm of visual depiction set by photography and film as the supergenre of all (moving-)images. On the other hand, (moving-)images are no longer in the past perfect tense; rather, over-titling systems remediate them to be what I called “augmented/augmenting media,” opening them up to further manipulations of post-producers and audiences.Over-titling thus produces new modes of seeing and mandates a new type of spectatorship. A film is encouraged to be watched multiple times, with or without the overlaid titles, instead of being the one-time entertainment as theatrical cinema institutionalized. The spectators, as the epitome of our current society, are multi-tasking, silent-but-chatty, distracted-but-observing, oscillating between the sadistic spectators and what Jacque Ranciere called “the emancipated spectators.” BIOJianqing Chen（陈剑青）is a doctoral student in Film & Media at U.C.

Employing a three-pronged, mixed-methods approach, this talk combines corpus maps from the e-Diasporas Atlas project, data obtained from web-based content analysis, and key informant interviews. It offers insight into the mutually embedded relationship between Internet web 2.0 technologies and contemporary diaspora politics. The research findings highlight the ways in which web 2.0 technologies are supporting and enabling more public and personalized forms of diaspora identity politics from the ground up, as well as the growing interconnectedness between online political participation, identity-based expressions, and offline political mobilization activities.

It was a formative institution of modernity, contributing to a massive reimagining of politics and the arts, of the market for culture, of ideas about leisure, and of practices of professionalism. The Grand Tour Project enriches our understanding of this phenomenon by bringing us closer to the diverse travelers, elite and otherwise, who collectively constituted its world. The project involves working with the more than five thousand entries in John Ingamells’ Dictionary of British and Irish Travelers to Italy, in order to create a dynamic searchable database and digital visualizations of these travelers’ journeys and lives. This talk will introduce the challenges we face in transforming a print reference work into a interactive digital resource, and will make the case for the unique historical scholarship that such a resource can offer scholars and the general public alike. Giovanna Ceserani is Associate Professor of Classics at Stanford where she teaches and researches the intellectual history of Classics in the modern age. The recipient of a New Direction Mellon Fellowship (2012-15), she is the author of Italy’s Lost Greece: Magna Graecia and The Making of Modern Archaeology (OUP 2012). The Grand Tour Project—which she started within the Mapping Republic of Letters collaborative research effort in 2008--emerged from her research on eighteenth-century travel to classical lands. The use of digital technologies to address historical questions, and the transforming of these results into historiographical arguments and narratives, continues to be a most rewarding aspect of the project for her.

Through analyses of film, music, and social media, this talk will discuss the intimacies and frictions that have developed around the legacies of African enslavement and Indian indentureship in Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, and Guyana. Dr. Iyer is the Faculty Coordinator of the CCSRE Research Network, Black and Brown Intimacies across Africa, South Asia, and the Caribbean. RSVP required. RSVP here . Zoom information available for RSVPs. Food and wine will be provided to the in person attendees. About the Speaker Usha Iyer is an Assistant Professor in the Art and Art History Department at Stanford University. Their research and teaching interests lie at the intersection of cinema, performance, and gender and sexuality studies, with a specific focus on Global South cultural traffic along the vectors of race, gender, caste, and religion. Iyer (she/they) is the author of Dancing Women: Choreographing Corporeal Histories of Hindi Cinema (Oxford University Press, 2020), which examines constructions of gender, stardom, sexuality, and spectacle in Hindi cinema through women’s labor, collaborative networks, and gestural genealogies to produce a corporeal history of South Asian cultural modernities. Iyer’s current book project, Jammin’: Black and Brown Media Intimacies between India and the Caribbean (under contract with Columbia University Press), studies the deep affective engagement of Caribbean spectators with Indian cinema in relation to discourses of belonging and citizenship that have developed around the histories of African enslavement and Indian indentureship in Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, and Guyana. The book equally attends to the impact of Caribbean cultural forms on Indian film industries, which, through pirate and informal networks appropriated and adapted soca, chutney, and other musical and performance forms that were products of a creole modernity.  Iyer is co-editing with Manishita Dass the volume, Shift Focus: Reframing the Indian New Waves (under contract with Oxford University Press). This anthology brings together a diverse group of scholars to examine the unexplored cultural, political, and aesthetic genealogies, impulses, and resonances of the Indian New Waves. Iyer is the Annenberg Faculty Fellow, School of the Humanities and Sciences (2022-2024), and serves as affiliate faculty in Stanford's Center for South Asia, the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CCSRE), and in the Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (FGSS) program.

This talk, presented by Nicholas Jenkins (PI on the in-progress Kindred London digital humanities project) and Erik Steiner (Co-Director of the Spatial History Project at CESTA), focuses on a new map of London’s neighborhoods that Jenkins and Steiner have created for use in Kindred London . The Steiner-Jenkins map is an effort to identify and outline some 260 neighborhoods of London, giving a new set of shapes and forms to the city’s districts as identified by daily experience and collective understanding. The map, part tool and part artwork, the product of both research and imagination, draws on a wide range of printed sources, social media, administrative data, colloquial descriptions, commercial mapping sites and personal accounts. The result is a “soft city”, a representation of space that (like all maps) draws lines and edges. But the visual forms in play here are biomorphic not jagged, softly curved not angular, and the Steiner-Jenkins map tries to embrace the human reality of overlapping definitions of place and of perceptual uncertainties. Modern mapping systems thrive on a claim to being comprehensive, objective and absolute. But culturally-defined places, like those which are the subject of the Steiner-Jenkins map, are spatially contentious, defined from the bottom-up, and evolving. What is more, they don’t conform to the invisible barriers put up by administrative definitions of space (census blocks, precincts, zip codes). Neighborhood definitions are democratic, mutable and subjective; as such, they play a major role in organizing citizens' behavior. For these reasons, the Steiner-Jenkins biomorphic map of London brings into view important disciplinary questions about subjectivity, ambiguity and the aesthetic within the field of the spatial humanities. Nicholas Jenkins is the Primary Investigator for the forthcoming Kindred London and for Kindred Britain , described by the Economist as ""an amazing digital humanities website that traces relations between 30,000 British people.” He has edited a Lincoln Kirstein Reader and co-edited and contributed to three volumes of Oxford University Press's ""Auden Studies"" series.

Mark Algee-Hewitt’s research focuses on the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in England and Germany and seeks to combine literary criticism with digital and quantitative analyses of literary texts. In particular he is interested in the history of aesthetic theory and the development and transmission of aesthetic and philosophic concepts during the Enlightenment and Romantic periods.

The Stanford Oral History Text Analysis Project, which we created to explore twentieth-century women’s narratives of sexual assault and harassment, has compiled a corpus of 2500 oral history transcripts from varied U.S. repositories. We developed a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, including an original search tool, called Winnow; NVivo coding; metadata/coding analysis; and close reading. At this presentation we will illustrate how combining these methods help us understand which women recalled which types of sexual violence, the ways they spoke about them, and how these narratives changed over time. In addition to the implications of the results for our understanding of sexual violence, these mixed methods can be applied to any research topic. Our work encourages oral historians and archivists to adopt standard practices in order to enable widescale textual analysis of digital oral history transcripts.

This event is co-sponsored by the Ptarmigan Fund for Late Ancient Studies and CESTA. About Jordan Crouser Jordan Crouser is a visual analytics researcher and semi-professional data wrangler. He is passionate about learning, and his teaching philosophy is grounded in three simple principles: each learner builds and rebuilds her own body of knowledge; people build the things they care about; and people keep building when they can see that they’re making progress. In the classroom and in his research, he encourages students to challenge their working models of the world in service of problems that matter to them. His research program investigates the complementary nature of human and machine computation as used in visual analytics and other human-machine collaborative systems. These systems make use of the human visual system, as well as our capacity to understand and reason about complex data. He has published his technical contributions in the areas of visualization theory , human-computer interaction , educational technology , visual analytics systems and human computation . Prior to returning to academia, Crouser spent two years doing research and building analytical tools at MIT Lincoln Laboratory . Crouser earned his master's in educational technology and doctorate in computer science in 2013 from the VALT: Visual Analytics Laboratory at Tufts University and is also a proud member of the Smith College class of 2008.

I tentatively term this the problem of relating the imperial imaginary and imperial reality. This presentation discusses the first complete phase of a project on the imaginary and real geographies of the eighteenth-century British maritime empire, using digital methods (custom named entity recognition) and mapping to compare place names mentioned in maritime fiction and nonfiction to the movements of British ships. In addition to those results and analyses, I will speculate on future research that might venture beyond this period and track more than place names.

The abrupt break caused by the French Revolution in 1789 and the subsequent Napoleonic era have sometimes been seen as implicit temporal boundaries to this field of study. This has been reinforced by the chosen areas of specialization of many scholars, which in many cases separate the study of the eighteenth century from the revolutionary and Napoleonic periods. In contrast, this seminar aims to rethink our understanding of the long eighteenth century in France from a broader perspective, fostering dialogue between scholars of the late seventeenth century through to the post-revolutionary period. Among the topics addressed, special attention is given to cultural practices, networks, the circulation of ideas, gender issues, inequalities, and social dynamics. Through different approaches and perspectives, the seminar sheds new light on a period characterized by political, social and cultural changes, considering both elements of continuity and rupture. This seminar is co-sponsored by The Europe Center . The event has been sponsored by the project NapApps.

The 2023 Berkeley/Stanford Symposium, “In-Between: Art and Cultural Practices From Here,” confronts the potentials of those people, spaces, things, ideas, and experiences of the past, present, and future, as they manifest between categories of analysis we might have inherited from previous canons. Situating the symposium within the conceptual space of the “in-between,” we ask our participants to join in proposing new frameworks of hybridity and transdisciplinarity. These approaches are grounded in transregional and intersectional practices that, nonetheless, engage with specificities of place. This symposium will take place on Friday, April 28th from 10am - 5pm at the SFMOMA, and is free and open to the public.

However, most critical investigation of maps continues on a small scale, through close readings of a few maps. Individual maps communicate through visual grammars, supplemented by text. The text found on maps, particularly in aggregate, is a nearly untapped source about the construction of knowledge about place. Over the course of the last year, Machines Reading Maps (MRM) has worked with the David Rumsey Map Collection and its partner Luna Imaging to make maps searchable by their text content, creating the possibility for humanities research that uses text on maps as a primary source and transforming map collection discovery. MRM began in 2021 as a collaborative project with researchers and librarians at the University of Southern California Digital Library, the University of Minnesota, The Alan Turing Institute, as well as heritage partners at the British Library, the Library of Congress, and the National Library of Scotland. While we speak colloquially about reading maps, MRM concretely addresses how to make text on maps an accessible resource. Spatial searching will no longer be limited to metadata fields like place of publication, or general subject, but instead will allow queries based upon the labeled, spatial content of maps. On April 20th and 21st, 2023, The David Rumsey Map Center at Stanford University will host a gathering of the MRM x David Rumsey Map Collection extended team, faculty, library specialists, developers and select invited guests to unveil the results of the MRM x David Rumsey Map Collection work, present technical details of the process and pipelines, and seek input on the future evolution of MRM, from a project to a community supported toolkit.

Early modern diasporas imparted further impetus to these exchanges, fostering the circulation of people, books, and ideas. Some of those ideas opposed the doctrines of the three Mediterranean monotheistic religions and had thus to be disseminated covertly to escape censorship. This talk will focus on a series of texts originated in the Iberian Peninsula in the 15th century that popularized a radical form of skepticism. They were translated often anonymously into various vernacular languages and spread widely throughout a network of pirate editions and clandestine travelers. Given their content and the dissimulation strategies employed to distribute them, these texts appear often mysterious. This talk suggests that digital humanities tools, employed alongside traditional philological research, can help us address their secret character as well as offer a novel perspective on these radical networks. It also discusses the potentialities and limitations of using information technology in areas of historical research and literary analysis that are inherently characterized by missing data, uncertainty, and tentative conclusions.

Her work focuses on Muslim devotional life, especially sacred spaces and ritual practice. Current research concerns the circulation of devotional objects at Sufi shrines in India and Turkey. Professor Bigelow’s current book project is a comparative study of shared sacred sites in India and Turkey tentatively titled Sacred Space and the Secular State: Studies in India and Turkey . This work interrogates the shifting nature of secularism as experienced, interpreted, and adjudicated through shared sacred spaces. Her first book, Sharing the Sacred: Practicing Pluralism in Muslim North India (Oxford University Press, 2010) is a study of a Muslim majority town in Indian Punjab and the shared sacred and civic spaces of that community. Bigelow is co-editor (with Kambiz GhaneaBassiri) and contributor to a special issue (6:2) on Material Islam of the Yale journal MAVCOR (Material and Visual Cultures of Religion). She also edited the volume Islam through Objects (Bloomsbury, 2021) representing the state of the field of Islamic material cultural studies with chapters focusing on particular things as entryways into wider Muslim worlds. Professor Bigelow received her BA from Smith College, MA from Columbia University, and PhD in Religious Studies from UC Santa Barbara. Her research received support from the Carnegie Scholars Program, the Social Science Research Council, and the American Institute of Indian Studies, among others.","Tue February 28th 2023, 12:00 - 1:15pm",Wallenberg 433A,"Anna Bigelow (PERSON); Storymapping Shared Sacred Sites: A Work/Site in Progress (WORK_OF_ART); Anna Bigelow (PERSON); Storymapping Shared Sacred Sites: A Work/Site in Progress Photo (WORK_OF_ART); Mehmet Okutan (PERSON); USA (GPE); France (GPE); the Abbasi Program in Islamic Studies (ORG); the Stanford Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (ORG); Wallenberg 433A (FAC); Zoom (PRODUCT); Center Manager (ORG); Jonathan Clark (PERSON); Anna Bigelow (PERSON); Islamic Studies (ORG); South Asia (LOC); the Middle East (LOC); Muslim (NORP); Sufi (NORP); India (GPE); Turkey (GPE); Bigelow’s (PERSON); India (GPE); Turkey (GPE); Sacred Space and the Secular State: Studies (WORK_OF_ART); India (GPE); Turkey (GPE); first (ORDINAL); Sharing the Sacred: Practicing Pluralism in Muslim North India (WORK_OF_ART); Oxford University Press (ORG); 2010 (DATE); Muslim (NORP); Indian Punjab (GPE); Bigelow (PERSON); Kambiz GhaneaBassiri (PERSON); 6:2 (CARDINAL); Material Islam of the Yale journal MAVCOR (Material and Visual Cultures of Religion (WORK_OF_ART); Islam through Objects (Bloomsbury, 2021 (WORK_OF_ART); Islamic (NORP); Muslim (NORP); Bigelow (PERSON); BA (WORK_OF_ART); Smith College (ORG); MA (GPE); Columbia University (ORG); PhD in Religious Studies (ORG); UC (GPE); Santa Barbara (GPE); the Carnegie Scholars Program (ORG); the Social Science Research Council (ORG); the American Institute of Indian Studies (ORG)","Anna Bigelow, Anna Bigelow, Mehmet Okutan, Jonathan Clark, Anna Bigelow, Bigelow’s, Bigelow, Kambiz GhaneaBassiri, Bigelow","Kambiz GhaneaBassiri, Anna Bigelow, Mehmet Okutan, Jonathan Clark"

The premise of the project is that the smartphone has become for many the signature technology and engine of experience in the twenty-first century. One of the project's larger claims is that ambient givenness of smartphones in contemporary life has significantly reorganized the human sensorium and, moreover, has elevated the significance of experience at the level of the skin's surface, or what the psychoanalyst Thomas Ogden terms ""boundedness."" This talk attends to the ways in which this dramatic shift in the general orientation of experience entails a sea change in the general nature of aesthetics native and responsive to the always-on world. Discussing a variety of examples from film, literature, video, games, digital art, and vernacular aesthetic forms and genres, this talk explores six ""theses"" of aesthetics in this still-novel yet ordinary arena. This event is hosted by Digital Aesthetics Workshop and is co-sponsored with the Department of English and the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA). Register here to join online . James J. Hodge (he/him/his, Ph.D. University of Chicago) is an Associate Professor in the English Department of Northwestern University. He specializes in digital media aesthetics across several contexts, including new media art, popular and experimental cinema, animation, and literature. Focusing also on media and critical theory he has special interests in phenomenology and psychoanalysis. He is also a core faculty member of the interschool PhD program in Rhetoric, Media, and Publics, and affiliate faculty in Art History and Screen Cultures. His research is broadly devoted to the question of how artistic forms express the incoherence of lived experience. His first book Sensations of History: Animation and New Media Art (Minnesota, 2019) argues that animation becomes crucial for understanding the ways in which history changes in the digital age. His current book project, ""Ordinary Media: An Aesthetics of Always-On Computing"" examines a range of experimental and popular digital artworks in their capacity to express the felt dynamics of always-on computing: from depression and anxiety to sociability, productivity, and vulnerability. This and other recent work attend to the explosion of new networked genres such as supercuts, memes, selfies, and animated GIFs, and theorizes them as aesthetic strategies of provisional attunement to the vicissitudes of the historical present.","Tue April 30th 2024, 5:00 - 7:00pm",Stanford Humanities Center Board Room and Zoom,"Six (CARDINAL); James Hodge's (PERSON); Ordinary Media: An Aesthetics of Always-On Computing (WORK_OF_ART); the twenty-first century (DATE); One (CARDINAL); Thomas Ogden (PERSON); Six (CARDINAL); James Hodge's (PERSON); Ordinary Media: An Aesthetics of Always-On Computing (WORK_OF_ART); the twenty-first century (DATE); One (CARDINAL); Thomas Ogden (PERSON); six (CARDINAL); Digital Aesthetics Workshop (ORG); the Department of English (ORG); the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (ORG); CESTA (ORG); James J.

With regard to spatial metaphors, cognitive literary scholars have shown that variants of cardiocentrism – the notion that the heart is the center of cognition and emotional life – originated independently in multiple cultures, thus confirming the internalist intuition. By contrast, the distributed view of cognition holds that the mind “extends beyond the skin” and emphasizes the social, dispersed, and external nature of emotions.",Maciej Kurzynski: Words Close to Heart: A Techno-Cognitive Approach to Interiority in Modern Chinese Literature,"Representations of interiority in literature have been approached from both spatial and temporal perspectives. With regard to spatial metaphors, cognitive literary scholars have shown that variants of cardiocentrism – the notion that the heart is the center of cognition and emotional life – originated independently in multiple cultures, thus confirming the internalist intuition. By contrast, the distributed view of cognition holds that the mind “extends beyond the skin” and emphasizes the social, dispersed, and external nature of emotions. In terms of temporal metaphors, the diachronic approach identifies epistemic shifts in cultural history whereby one discursive formation gives way to another in a revolutionary fashion. According to the synchronic view, however, literary representations of interiority remain fairly stable despite cultural transformations. In this talk, I propose a techno-cognitive approach to interiority in literature which mediates all four perspectives, and I apply it to Chinese texts. My work builds upon word embeddings, a computational technology that allows us to represent the meaning of words as vectors in a multidimensional space. Measuring semantic shifts between time-specific vector representations of the term “in one’s heart” ( xinli 心里) and its synonyms ( xinzhong 心中, neixin 内心, xinxia 心下, etc.) in early modern and modern Chinese literature, I account for all four poles in the graph: continuity and discontinuity, contextuality and the hors-texte.

Using the tools of modern data analysis and ten years of pioneering research, new evidence is provided about the past and present of the American Dream, debunking myths fostered by political opportunism and sentimentalized in family histories. Using powerful story-telling and unprecedented research employing big data and algorithms, Abramitzky and Boustan provide a new take on American history with surprising results, especially how comparable the “golden era” of immigration is to today, and why many current policy proposals are so misguided.

Sullivan: Sacred Vision at Saqqara: Reimagining the sensorium of the dead at an ancient Egyptian necropolis in 3D,"This workshop introduces one of the most effective forms of ritual communication and connection in ancient Egyptian culture which took place through human sight. Seeing was a reciprocal act, with the eye an active agent that reached out—a concept likely stemming from the myth of the powerful ‘divine eye’. In looking upon the god (or the king in his divine form), a person interacted with him or her, benefited from their divine presence, and could even be healed by this vision, and thus prayers to ‘see the god’ were repeated in a variety of types of texts. The effect of such sacred vision (and other sensory experiences) was key for both the living and the dead. In this talk, I will argue that the necropolis landscape of Saqqara was structured to promote ritual sight lines and provide the deceased with eternal views of the god or king. For this study, I use primary source texts and artistic depictions related to funerary and mortuary cult events at the site of Saqqara, as well as data gleaned from a 3D GIS model of the site that visualises physical and material elements of the cemetery frequently indiscernible today. Elaine A. Sullivan (M.A. and Ph.D. in Egyptian Art and Archaeology from Johns Hopkins University) is an Egyptologist and a Digital Humanist whose work focuses on applying new technologies to ancient cultural materials. Her born-digital publication, Constructing the Sacred, utilizes a geo-temporal 3D model of the necropolis of Saqqara (near modern Cairo) to investigate questions of ritual landscape and visibility at the site. This digital monograph ( https://constructingthesacred.org , Stanford University Press, 2020) was awarded prizes by the American Historical Association and the Archaeological Institute of America. Her archaeological work in Egypt includes five seasons of excavation with Johns Hopkins University at the temple of the goddess Mut (Luxor), as well as four seasons in the field with a joint UCLA-Rijksuniversiteit Groningen project in the Egyptian Fayum at the Greco-Roman town of Karanis.  Sullivan has published extensively on the use of digital technologies for research and scholarship.

While many scholars have focused on the political motivations of the assailants -- the so-called ""Paxton boys"" -- and the aftermath of the mob violence, Ghost River foregrounds the Indigenous experience by drawing upon unpublished manuscript records and the perspectives of contemporary Lenape (Delaware) peoples, whose ancestors survived settler colonial violence across the trans-Appalachian West. Ghost River weaves a transhistorical literary web of historical artifacts, historical fiction, and Native artwork that reimagines colonial history from a Native present. The project was led by a Native author (Dr. Lee Francis 4), artist (Weshoyot Alvitre), publisher (Red Planet), and press (Tribal Print Source), and the narrative was refined through sustained consultation with both Lenape cultural advisors and early Americanists. Today the graphic novel is available in print and freely available online . In this Lunch Seminar at the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis , Will Fenton, CESTA's associate director and editor of Ghost River, will discuss the origins of the graphic novel -- the digital humanities project Digital Paxton -- the collaborative process behind the project, and the opportunities and challenges for Native consultation in the context of tribal sovereignty in mid-Atlantic.

Nora Barakat , Assistant Professor of History, Stanford University David Wrisley , Professor of Digital Humanities, NYU Abu Dhabi What are the historical connections between the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Indian Ocean Rim? How can scholars approach this historical space from a fragmented postcolonial vantage point of nation states and their archives? This lecture presents the process and results of research collaboration that aims to reframe and expand Gulf Studies beyond dominant narratives of nation-building and fossil fuels.

Narrative and Social Crisis in the Platform Age""","Join us for the next Digital Horizons Lecture, co-presented by the Stanford Humanities Center and the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA). As the COVID-19 pandemic winds down, critics and scholars have begun to ask: how will culture (fiction, film, TV) memorialize this massive social crisis? What will be the COVID-19 ""narrative?"" However, since early 2020, tens of thousands of ordinary online users, on popular writing platforms like Wattpad, have been writing about COVID-19 (i.e. #Covid) in real time. This talk combines computational and critical methods, leveraging the affordances of Internet data, to study how individuals internalized COVID-19 by writing stories about it, ad hoc and before anyone knew how the story would end. What kinds of stories did they write? What kinds of social worlds did they imagine? How did those stories evolve over time, as the world learned more about the pandemic? More broadly, this talk reflects on the impact of new writing platforms on how we understand the relationship between writing and social representation, models rooted traditionally in pre-Internet print culture. How are such platforms changing what it means to narrate a social event? How is user generated content impacting traditional publishing—how is #Covid19 anticipating the novels, films, and TV shows to come?

In their quantitative emphasis, based for example on shipping records, many such studies have diverged from more humanistic approaches, for which the focus has sometimes been on individuals whose lives are reconstructed in micro-narratives. While the scholarly value of big data in studying enslavement is beyond dispute, new projects come at a troubling moment in US history: for many North Americans, the legacies of enslavement are very much to the fore amidst heightened racial tensions and deepening economic inequalities. If, in such an environment, the term @nomorenames is politically significant, what implications might there be for scholarship? What are the trans-American perspectives and histories on the ""Data of Enslavement""? Is it possible that scholars with their data practices—even unconsciously and unwillingly—are adding new epistemological violence to the physical violence of the past? Join us on April 25th at 3 pm, for the ""Data of Enslavement"", the 7th session of our year-long Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series. We will hear from Lauren Klein, Alex Borucki, and Greg O'Malley about how they bring in humanistic approaches to large historical datasets in this sensitive theme and how they use these historical data to understand injustices in our contemporary world. If you cannot attend in person, you can request Zoom information via this link . Before the seminar, there will be a reception with appetizers starting at 2:30 pm. About the Speakers  Alex Borucki is professor of history at the University of California, Irvine. He is the author of From Shipmates to Soldiers: Emerging Black Identities in the Río de la Plata (2015), co-editor of From the Galleon to the Highlands: Slave Trade Routes in the Spanish Americas (2020), and co-editor of The Rio de la Plata from Colony to Nations : Commerce, Society, and Politics (2021). Apart from other Spanish-language books and articles, he has published on the slave trade and the African Diaspora in the American Historical Review, Hispanic American Historical Review, William and Mary Quarterly, Colonial Latin American Review, The Americas, History in Africa, Itinerario, Atlantic Studies , and Slavery and Abolition . He is currently writing a book, co-authored with José Luis Belmonte Postigo, provisionally entitled “The Slave Trade and Silver in the Refinancing of the Spanish Empire during the Age of Revolutions.” By focusing on coastal merchant elites living in the Americas, this book examines how the availability of silver exports in several regions defined the timing, direction, and size of the slave trade in the Spanish Americas during the Age of Revolutions, when the traffic of captives gained prominence within the overall commerce and the financing of the colonial regime from Cuba to Buenos Aires.   Lauren Klein is Winship Distinguished Research Professor and Associate Professor in the departments of Quantitative Theory & Methods and English at Emory University. At Emory, she also serves as director of the Digital Humanities Lab and PI of the Mellon-funded Atlanta Interdisciplinary AI Network . Previously, she taught in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at Georgia Tech. Klein’s research brings together computational and critical methods in order to explore questions of gender, race, and justice, both in the past and in the present. She is the author of An Archive of Taste: Race and Eating in the Early United States (University of Minnesota Press, 2020) and, with Catherine D’Ignazio, the award-winning Data Feminism (MIT Press, 2020). With Matthew K. Gold, she edits Debates in the Digital Humanities , a hybrid print-digital publication stream that explores debates in the field as they emerge. Her work has appeared in leading humanities journals including PMLA, American Literature, and American Quarterly ; and at technical conferences including ACL , EMNLP , and IEEE VIS . Her research has been supported by grants and fellowships from the ACLS, the NEH, and the Mellon Foundation. Her next major project, Data by Design: An Interactive History of Data Visualization , is forthcoming from the MIT Press in 2024.   Greg O’Malley is professor of history at the University of California, Santa Cruz. His first book, Final Passages: The Intercolonial Slave Trade of British America, 1619-1807 , received four awards: The America Historical Association’s Forkosch Prize for British history; the AHA’s Rawley Prize for Atlantic history; The Owsley Award from the Southern Historical Association; and the Goveia Prize from the Association of Caribbean Historians. The project examines a complex network for distributing enslaved Africans throughout North America and the Caribbean after their survival of the Atlantic crossing. O’Malley is also co-creator (with Alex Borucki) of the Intra-American Slave Trade Database, an online research tool that documents more than 35,000 slave trading voyages from one port in the Americas to another. His second book, The Escapes of David George: An Odyssey of Slavery and Freedom in the Revolutionary Era , is forthcoming with St. Martin’s Press. It offers a life history of a man born enslaved in colonial Virginia, whose attempts to escape bondage resulted in wide-ranging travels, captivities, and re-enslavements, illuminating both enslaved people’s resistance and the constraints on their lives. David George eventually achieved emancipation by fleeing the emerging United States and running to the British Army during the Revolutionary War.","Thu April 25th 2024, 3:00 - 4:30pm","Building 160, Wallenberg Hall 450 Jane Stanford Way, Building 160, Stanford, CA 94305 433A","Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series: Data of Enslavement (WORK_OF_ART); Lauren Klein (PERSON); Alex Borucki (PERSON); Gregory O'Malley (PERSON); Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis Enslavement (ORG); American (NORP); Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series: Data of Enslavement (WORK_OF_ART); Lauren Klein (PERSON); Alex Borucki (PERSON); Gregory O'Malley (PERSON); American (NORP); US (GPE); North Americans (NORP); trans-American (NORP); April 25th (DATE); 3 pm (TIME); the ""Data of Enslavement"" (WORK_OF_ART); 7th (ORDINAL); Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series (WORK_OF_ART); Lauren Klein (PERSON); Alex Borucki (PERSON); Greg O'Malley (PERSON); Zoom (PRODUCT); 2:30 pm (TIME); Alex Borucki (PERSON); the University of California, Irvine (ORG); From Shipmates to Soldiers: Emerging Black Identities in the Río de la Plata (WORK_OF_ART); 2015 (DATE); From the Galleon to the Highlands: Slave Trade Routes in the Spanish Americas (WORK_OF_ART); 2020 (DATE); The Rio de la Plata from Colony to Nations : Commerce, Society, and Politics (WORK_OF_ART); 2021 (DATE); Spanish (LANGUAGE); African (NORP); the American Historical Review (ORG); Hispanic American Historical Review, William and Mary Quarterly, Colonial Latin American Review (WORK_OF_ART); The Americas, History in Africa, Itinerario, Atlantic Studies (WORK_OF_ART); Slavery and Abolition (WORK_OF_ART); José Luis Belmonte Postigo (PERSON); The Slave Trade and Silver in the Refinancing of the Spanish Empire during the Age of Revolutions (WORK_OF_ART); Americas (LOC); Spanish (NORP); Americas (LOC); the Age of Revolutions (EVENT); Cuba (GPE); Buenos Aires (GPE); Lauren Klein (PERSON); Winship (PERSON); Quantitative Theory & Methods (ORG); English (LANGUAGE); Emory University (ORG); Emory (ORG); the Digital Humanities Lab (ORG); Mellon (ORG); Atlanta Interdisciplinary AI Network (ORG); the School of Literature, Media (ORG); Georgia Tech (ORG); Klein’s (PERSON); An Archive of Taste: Race and Eating in the Early United States (WORK_OF_ART); University of Minnesota Press (ORG); 2020 (DATE); Catherine D’Ignazio (PERSON); Data Feminism (WORK_OF_ART); MIT Press (WORK_OF_ART); 2020 (DATE); Matthew K.

One reason why these sources have often been neglected is that they defy any individual’s capacity for close reading. This talk presents a distant reading of the titles of over 20,000 legal dissertations written at German universities during the seventeenth century. Providing a pathway into a forbidding archive, it highlights the dissertations’ interest for the history of jurisprudence and its receptiveness to social change, the history of universities and academic publishing, baroque rhetoric, and cultural, political, and economic history. The talk also discusses a visualization technique used to examine whether shifts in subjects, methods, or language can be attributed to specific age cohorts or whether they were adopted across generations.

While some sites are protected by state legislation, a very significant number are not. This fragile record of human adaption to the varied Central Asian landscapes is under threat: including changing agricultural practices (especially the climate crisis and resultant collapse of the ‘third pole’ in the Himalaya-Hindu Kush mountain ranges), urban expansion, and rural depopulation. The future depends on strategic planning, where archaeological resources are considered as part of sustainable development policies. This cannot happen unless there is a solid, and accessible, platform of information for local agencies to engage in this debate. Made possible by funding from the Arcadia Fund – a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin - CAAL is developing a digital open-access inventory. Teams from over twenty institutions in six countries are helping to create a digital inventory of archaeological landscapes. Remote sensing teams are mapping and exploring from above. Archival teams are delving into often fragile and unpublished records of a century of research and digitising pages, glass plate images, films, colour renderings, hand drawn maps and field diaries. Together this digital data will provide a unique source of information for researchers and heritage managers. About the speaker: Tim Williams is Professor of Silk Roads Archaeology at UCL. His research considers urban archaeology, especially in Roman, Islamic, and Central Asian contexts. He’s the Director of a long-running research project at Merv, Turkmenistan, which has been operating since 2001. This collaboration between the Turkmenistan Ministry of Culture, the Ancient Merv State Park, and the UCL Institute of Archaeology aims to research and conserve the remains of one of the great historic cities of the Silk Roads. Professor Williams will reflect upon how digital humanities, and in particular digital inventories, has opened up new opportunities for the study of the Central Asian past.","Thu May 19th 2022, 9:00am","Online, via Zoom","Tim Williams (PERSON); Central Asia (LOC); Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis Abstract: The Central Asian Archaeological Landscape project (WORK_OF_ART); CAAL (ORG); Central Asia (LOC); Republic of Kazakhstan (GPE); Kyrgyz Republic, Republic of Tajikistan (GPE); Turkmenistan (GPE); Republic of Uzbekistan (GPE); the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China (GPE); Tim Williams (PERSON); Central Asia (LOC); Abstract: The Central Asian Archaeological Landscape project (WORK_OF_ART); CAAL (ORG); Central Asia (LOC); Republic of Kazakhstan (GPE); Kyrgyz Republic, Republic of Tajikistan (GPE); Turkmenistan (GPE); Republic of Uzbekistan (GPE); the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China (GPE); Central Asian (NORP); third (ORDINAL); Himalaya-Hindu Kush (LOC); the Arcadia Fund (ORG); Lisbet Rausing (ORG); Peter Baldwin - CAAL (ORG); over twenty (CARDINAL); six (CARDINAL); a century (DATE); Tim Williams (PERSON); Silk Roads Archaeology (ORG); UCL (ORG); Roman (NORP); Islamic (NORP); Central Asian (NORP); Merv (ORG); Turkmenistan (GPE); 2001 (DATE); the Turkmenistan Ministry of Culture (ORG); the Ancient Merv State Park (FAC); the UCL Institute of Archaeology (ORG); one (CARDINAL); the Silk Roads (LOC); Williams (PERSON); Central Asian (NORP)","Tim Williams, Tim Williams, Tim Williams, Williams",Tim Williams

The Hajj Trail takes students along the route of the seventeenth-century Ottoman pilgrimage road to Mecca, introducing them to the cultural history of the early modern Ottoman World. The goal of the project is to present the history of the Ottoman Empire/Islamic World to a broader public in a narrative which does not center perceptions of the region around violence and warfare – as is depicted in most other digital media. The entire project is built through a user-friendly coding platform called Twine and presents students with historical scenarios based upon early modern travel and pilgrimage narratives. The talk will outline both the goals of this project and overview the tools that we utilized to build it. About the speaker: Dr. Tyler Kynn is an instructor of Global History at the University of Memphis, and his primary research focus is the seventeenth-century Ottoman pilgrimage to Mecca. Dr. Kynn received his Ph.D. in History from Yale University in 2020 and combines his research on the Ottoman hajj with his digital humanities project, The Hajj Trail. This project aims to be the public facing digital medium for his study of the intersection of the early modern hajj, empire, and the seasonality of imperial power.","Tue May 17th 2022, 12:00 - 1:15pm",Hybrid event: in-person at CESTA and via Zoom.,Tyler Kynn (PERSON); On the Road to Mecca: Simulating the Ottoman Hajj (WORK_OF_ART); The Hajj Trail (WORK_OF_ART); seventeenth-century (DATE); Ottoman Empire (ORG); The Hajj Trail (FAC); seventeenth-century (DATE); Ottoman (NORP); Mecca (GPE); Ottoman World (EVENT); Tyler Kynn (PERSON); On the Road to Mecca: Simulating the Ottoman Hajj (WORK_OF_ART); The Hajj Trail (WORK_OF_ART); seventeenth-century (DATE); Ottoman Empire (ORG); The Hajj Trail (FAC); seventeenth-century (DATE); Ottoman (NORP); Mecca (GPE); Ottoman World (EVENT); the Ottoman Empire/Islamic World (ORG); Twine (PRODUCT); Tyler Kynn (PERSON); Global History (ORG); the University of Memphis (ORG); seventeenth-century (DATE); Ottoman (NORP); Mecca (GPE); Kynn (PERSON); Ph.D. in History (WORK_OF_ART); Yale University (ORG); 2020 (DATE); Ottoman (NORP); The Hajj Trail (WORK_OF_ART),"Tyler Kynn, Tyler Kynn, Tyler Kynn, Kynn",Tyler Kynn

These span people with disabilities being unable to read COVID-19 infographics to them being excluded from digital networks like social media and remote meetings which frequently and rapidly transmit highly visual information. One approach to increasing nonvisual access to information for people who are blind and low vision is artificial intelligence (AI), which promises automation and scalability. However, research and media reports continue to illuminate AI-bias and malicious applications. As these harms tend to impact people who already experience marginalization, the ethics of applying AI to solve perennial accessibility challenges is complicated. In this talk I will overview one project I led concerning one facet of information accessibility—how people are represented in human and AI-generated alternative (alt) text descriptions. I will share findings from interviews I conducted with blind people who rely on alt text to understand visual information and who also identified as a minoritized race or gender shown to be disproportionately misrepresented by AI-powered human recognition systems. From their experiences and perspectives, I synthesized alt text design considerations. However, I will conclude the talk with provocations for the audience, rooted in examples from art and disability activism, which ask us to move beyond future systems which invisibly automate alt text production to reveal and reimagine human-centered methods for interpreting visual content into nonvisual formats.

It builds on the successful digitization project (2011–2016) of the unclassified and closed for research Swedish governmental archive in the French Colonial Archives. SweCarCol orders these for Swedish colonial history indispensible records together with Saint Barthélemy holdings in Sweden and creates a database-driven integrated and reclassified Caribbean archive. This virtual archive is ordered with new criteria based in historical theory and Digital Humanities. It will open up for research into previously overlooked areas such as gender and the social history of the enslaved and free black majority population. In addition to the archival integration the three project members will create new historical data in the fields of demography, slave trade and commerce, and slave law and justice. GIS depictions of the colony, as well as new material on transatlantic slavery connections has already been discovered, and several new avenues of research are readily available. About the speakers : Ale Pålsson has been a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of History, Uppsala University, since June 2019. At Uppsala, he is a member of the project Swedish Caribbean Colonialism (VR2018-06064), funded by the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet), with the aim of digitizing and making accessible the majority of Swedish colonial records from Saint-Barthélemy. In his Ph.D. thesis, Our Side of the Water: Political Culture in the Swedish Colony of Saint Barthélemy 1800-1825 , he examines citizenship and political involvement among naturalized citizens, highlighting racial structures, gender roles and Atlantic World political symbolism. He has continued to examine social-historical aspects of the Swedish colony, as well as published research on modern literary interpretations of the colony. Victor Wilson has also been a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of History, Uppsala University, since June 2019.

He is also currently tasked with writing the history of the Society of Swedish Literature in Finland (Svenska litteratursällskapet i Finland). Victor's work is focused on Caribbean colonial and economic history, with a focus on Nordic free ports in the Caribbean. Within that context, Wilson has done research on and written about Swedish participation in the transatlantic and intra-Caribbean slave trade.
